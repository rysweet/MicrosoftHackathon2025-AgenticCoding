# Agent Bundle Generator - Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Agent Bundle Generator transforms natural language descriptions of desired agentic behaviors into standalone, zero-install executable agent bundles by creating specialized copies of the Amplihack framework with custom configurations, prompts, and tools tailored to specific use cases.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to describe an agentic behavior in natural language so that I can instantly get a specialized, zero-install agent system that performs that specific task without manual configuration.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### FR-1: Natural Language Input Processing

- System SHALL accept natural language prompts describing desired agentic behavior
- System SHALL parse and extract intent from user prompts
- System SHALL handle ambiguous prompts through clarification dialogue
- System SHALL support multiple input formats (CLI, API, file)

#### FR-2: Agent Generation

- System SHALL generate specialized agent definitions based on extracted intent
- System SHALL create custom prompts tailored to specific use cases
- System SHALL generate appropriate workflows for agent coordination
- System SHALL produce test suites for generated agents

#### FR-3: Bundle Creation

- System SHALL create self-contained copies of the Amplihack framework
- System SHALL include all required dependencies and tools
- System SHALL preserve base Amplihack capabilities while adding specializations
- System SHALL generate documentation for the specialized bundle

#### FR-4: Distribution and Execution

- System SHALL package bundles for zero-install uvx execution
- System SHALL publish bundles to GitHub repositories
- System SHALL enable direct execution from GitHub URLs
- System SHALL support versioning and updates

### Integration Requirements

#### IR-1: Claude Integration

- System SHALL include claude-trace debugging capabilities
- System SHALL integrate with Claude Code SDK
- System SHALL maintain API key security

#### IR-2: GitHub Integration

- System SHALL create and manage GitHub repositories
- System SHALL handle authentication and permissions
- System SHALL support both public and private repositories

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- NFR-1: Bundle generation SHALL complete in less than 30 seconds
- NFR-2: Generated bundles SHALL execute within 10 seconds of invocation
- NFR-3: System SHALL support parallel bundle generation

### Security Requirements

- NFR-4: System SHALL NOT expose API keys or secrets in bundles
- NFR-5: System SHALL validate all generated code for security vulnerabilities
- NFR-6: System SHALL prevent prompt injection attacks

### Compatibility Requirements

- NFR-7: Bundles SHALL work cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- NFR-8: System SHALL support Python 3.9+
- NFR-9: Bundles SHALL be backward compatible with base Amplihack

### Quality Requirements

- NFR-10: Generated code SHALL follow Amplihack philosophy (ruthless simplicity)
- NFR-11: System SHALL maintain >80% test coverage
- NFR-12: Bundles SHALL be reproducible from specifications

## Acceptance Criteria

### Bundle Generation

- [ ] Accept natural language prompts via CLI and API
- [ ] Generate complete Amplihack framework copy
- [ ] Create specialized agents matching described behavior
- [ ] Generate custom prompts and workflows
- [ ] Include appropriate test suites

### Distribution

- [ ] Package bundles for uvx execution
- [ ] Publish to GitHub repositories
- [ ] Enable zero-install execution via `uvx <github-url>`
- [ ] Support bundle versioning

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] Generated bundles pass all base Amplihack tests
- [ ] Bundle-specific tests validate custom behavior
- [ ] Documentation explains specialized features
- [ ] Security scanning passes without critical issues

### Use Case Validation

Successfully generate and execute bundles for:

- [ ] Daily development environment maintenance
- [ ] GitHub issue triage and management
- [ ] Code review automation
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Security audit automation

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Development Environment Maintenance

**Input:**

```
"create an agent I can run every day to reason over my dev system and keep it up to date for development in c++, golang, and rust"
```

**Expected Output:**

- Bundle with agents for:
  - Checking and updating compiler versions
  - Managing language toolchains
  - Updating package dependencies
  - Cleaning build artifacts
  - Optimizing IDE configurations

**Execution:**

```bash
uvx --from github.com/user/dev-maintenance-agent maintain
```

### Use Case 2: GitHub Issue Triage

**Input:**

```
"create an agent that can triage all the issues in my gh repo"
```

**Expected Output:**

- Bundle with agents for:
  - Analyzing issue content
  - Applying appropriate labels
  - Assigning priority based on impact
  - Identifying duplicate issues
  - Suggesting assignees
  - Generating triage reports

**Execution:**

```bash
uvx --from github.com/user/issue-triage-agent triage --repo myrepo
```

### Use Case 3: Code Review Automation

**Input:**

```
"create an agent that reviews PRs for security vulnerabilities and code quality"
```

**Expected Output:**

- Bundle with agents for:
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Code quality analysis
  - Style consistency checking
  - Test coverage validation
  - Review comment generation

**Execution:**

```bash
uvx --from github.com/user/code-review-agent review --pr 123
```

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with base Amplihack
- Bundle size should not exceed 50MB
- Must work within GitHub API rate limits
- Cannot modify core Amplihack philosophy

### Assumptions

- Users have GitHub accounts
- Users understand basic agent concepts
- Claude API is available
- uvx is installable on target systems
- Internet connectivity for bundle download

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

- Bundle generation success rate > 95%
- Zero-install execution success rate = 100%
- Bundle generation time < 30 seconds
- Bundle download/execution time < 10 seconds
- Test coverage > 80%

### Qualitative Metrics

- User satisfaction with generated agents
- Code quality of generated bundles
- Documentation clarity and completeness
- Community adoption rate

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

- **Risk:** Prompt ambiguity leads to incorrect agents
  - **Mitigation:** Implement clarification dialogue system

- **Risk:** Bundle size affects performance
  - **Mitigation:** Use compression and selective inclusion

- **Risk:** Version conflicts between components
