# Document-Driven Development: Overview

**Understanding the core principle and why it works**

---

## What is Document-Driven Development?

Document-Driven Development (DDD) is a systematic approach where:

1. **Documentation comes first** - You design and document the system before writing code
2. **Documentation IS the specification** - Code must match what docs describe exactly
3. **Approval gate** - Human reviews and approves design before implementation
4. **Implementation follows docs** - Code implements what documentation promises
5. **Testing verifies docs** - Tests ensure code matches documentation

**Core Principle**: "Documentation IS the specification. Code implements what documentation describes."

---

## The Traditional Problem

**Traditional approach**: Code → Docs

What happens:
- Docs written after code (if at all)
- Docs lag behind code changes
- Docs and code diverge over time
- AI tools load stale/conflicting docs
- Context poisoning leads to wrong implementations
- Bugs from misunderstanding requirements

**Result**: Documentation becomes untrustworthy. Developers stop reading docs. More bugs.

---

## The DDD Solution

**DDD approach**: Docs → Approval → Implementation

What happens:
- Design captured in docs first
- Human reviews and approves design
- **Only then** write code
- Code matches docs exactly
- Tests verify code matches docs
- Docs and code never diverge

**Result**: Documentation is always correct. Single source of truth. Fewer bugs.

## Why This Works (Especially for AI)

### 1. Prevents Context Poisoning

**Context poisoning** = AI loads inconsistent information, makes wrong decisions

**How DDD prevents it**:
- Single source of truth for each concept
- No duplicate documentation
- No stale docs (updated before code)
- Clear, unambiguous specifications

### 2. Clear Contracts First

**Problem**: Implementation complexity obscures design intent

**How DDD helps**:
- Docs define interfaces before implementation
- Contracts clear before complexity added
- Easier to review design than code
- Cheaper to fix design than implementation

### 3. Reviewable Design

**Problem**: Design flaws discovered after expensive implementation

**How DDD helps**:
- Design reviewed at approval gate
- Catch flaws before coding
- Iterate on docs (cheap) not code (expensive)
- Human judgment applied early

### 4. AI-Optimized

**Problem**: AI tools rely on docs for context

**How DDD helps**:
- Docs always current
- No conflicting information
- Clear specifications
- AI can't guess wrong (spec is clear)

### 5. No Drift

**Problem**: Docs and code slowly diverge over time

**How DDD helps**:
- Docs come first, so can't lag
- If code needs to differ, update docs first
- Always in sync by design
- Drift is impossible

### 6. Modular Alignment

**Problem**: Unclear module boundaries and interfaces

**How DDD helps**:
- Docs define "studs" (interfaces) first
- Then build "bricks" (implementations)
- Clear contracts between modules
- Regeneratable from specs

### 7. Human Judgment Preserved

**Problem**: Critical decisions made during coding under pressure

**How DDD helps**:
- Design decisions at planning phase
- Time to think through trade-offs
- Expert review before commitment
- Better decisions

## Philosophy Foundation

DDD builds on these principles:

### From [PHILOSOPHY.md](../../.claude/context/PHILOSOPHY.md)

**Ruthless Simplicity**:
- Start minimal, grow as needed
- Avoid future-proofing
- Question every abstraction
- Clear over clever

**Applied in DDD**:
- Simple docs easier to maintain
- No speculative features in docs
- Each doc has one clear purpose
- Progressive organization

**Bricks and Studs**:
- Self-contained modules
- Clear interfaces (studs)
- Regeneratable from spec
- Human architects, AI builds

**Applied in DDD**:
- Docs define interfaces (studs)
- Code implements modules (bricks)
- Can regenerate from docs
- Human reviews design, AI implements

## The Complete Process

```
Phase 0: Planning & Alignment
    ↓
    • Problem framing
    • Reconnaissance
    • Proposals and iteration
    • Shared understanding
    ↓
Phase 1: Documentation Retcon
    ↓
    • Update ALL docs to target state
    • Write as if already exists
    • Maximum DRY enforcement
    • Progressive organization
    ↓
Phase 2: Approval Gate ←─────┐
    ↓                         │
    • Human reviews design    │
    • Iterate until right     │ (iterate if needed)
    • THEN commit docs        │
    ↓                         │
    ├─────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Phase 3: Implementation Planning
    ↓
    • Code reconnaissance
    • Detailed plan
    • Right-sizing check
    ↓
Phase 4: Code Implementation
    ↓
    • Code matches docs exactly
    • Load full context
    • Commit incrementally
    ↓
Phase 5: Testing & Verification
    ↓
    • Test documented behaviors
    • Test as user would
    • AI is QA entity
    ↓
Phase 6: Cleanup & Push
    ↓
    • Remove temporary files
    • Final verification
    • Push to remote

## When to Use DDD

### ✅ Use DDD For

**Large changes**:
- New features requiring multiple files
- System redesigns or refactoring
- API changes affecting documentation
- Any change touching 10+ files
- Cross-cutting concerns

**High-stakes work**:
- User-facing features
- Breaking changes
- Complex integrations
- Architecture decisions

**Collaborative work**:
- Multiple developers involved
- Need clear specification
- External review required

### ❌ Don't Use DDD For

**Simple changes**:
- Typo fixes
- Single-file bug fixes
- Trivial updates
- Documentation-only changes

**Emergency situations**:
- Production hotfixes
- Critical security patches
- System down scenarios

**When uncertain**: Lean toward using DDD. Process prevents expensive mistakes.

## What Makes DDD Different

### Not Just "Write Docs First"

DDD is more than writing documentation before code:

**Traditional "docs first"**:
- Write docs
- Write code
- Docs drift over time
- No systematic process

**DDD**:
- Systematic process with phases
- Approval gate before implementation
- Specific techniques (file crawling, retcon, etc.)
- Built-in prevention of drift
- AI-optimized workflow

### Not Just "Spec-Driven Development"

DDD differs from traditional spec-driven development:

**Traditional specs**:
- Often separate from user docs
- Written in formal specification language
- Rarely updated after initial write
- Developers don't read them

**DDD**:
- User docs ARE the specs
- Written in clear human language
- Always current (updated first)
- Single source of truth
- Developers AND AI use them

## Common Misconceptions

### "This is too much process"

**Reality**: Process prevents expensive rework. An hour in planning saves days of coding wrong thing.

### "We don't have time for this"

**Reality**: You don't have time NOT to do this. Rework from misunderstanding costs far more than upfront clarity.

### "Our docs are already good"

**Reality**: If docs and code can diverge, they will. DDD makes divergence impossible by design.

### "AI doesn't need perfect docs"

**Reality**: AI makes wrong decisions confidently when docs conflict. Context poisoning is real and expensive.

### "This only works for big projects"

**Reality**: Works at any scale. Small projects benefit from clarity. Large projects require it.
