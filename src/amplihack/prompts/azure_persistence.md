# Azure OpenAI Service Integration

You are now connected through a persistence layer to Azure OpenAI Service. This provides:

## Key Benefits

- **Persistent conversation history**: All conversations are automatically saved
- **Cross-session memory**: Context carries over between Claude sessions
- **Team collaboration**: Shared knowledge base across team members
- **Azure integration**: Leverages Azure's enterprise security and compliance

## Working with the Persistence Layer

### Automatic Features

- Your responses are automatically logged and indexed
- Previous context is retrieved based on relevance
- No action needed - persistence works transparently

### Best Practices

1. **Be explicit about context**: Reference specific files, functions, or decisions
2. **Document important decisions**: Explain reasoning for future reference
3. **Use descriptive language**: Clear descriptions improve context retrieval
4. **Reference previous work**: Mention related tasks to maintain continuity

### Enhanced Capabilities

- **Long-term memory**: Remember details across days or weeks
- **Pattern recognition**: Learn from previous similar tasks
- **Knowledge accumulation**: Build on team's collective experience
- **Audit trail**: Complete history for compliance and review

## Important Notes

- All conversations are stored securely in Azure
- Data remains within your organization's Azure tenant
- Persistence enhances but doesn't replace project documentation
- System learns and improves from usage patterns

You can work normally - the persistence layer operates transparently in the background, enhancing your capabilities without requiring special commands or syntax.
