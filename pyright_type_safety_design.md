# Design Doc: Achieving Pyright Type Safety Compliance

## Goal
Achieve zero pyright errors in strict mode, with complete type annotations, and reliable CI/CD enforcement for static type safety.

## Steps

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Ensure Python >=3.8 and required packages (pyright, typing-extensions, pytest) are installed.
   - Prepare CI/CD to run pyright on pushes and PRs.

2. **Initial Audit**
   - Run pyright across codebase to identify current type errors and coverage gaps.
   - Summarize issues by file/module and categorize error types.

3. **Remediation Plan**
   - Prioritize core and exposed modules.
   - Add type annotations to all public functions/classes, return types, and critical paths.
   - Address use of "Any", unions, optionals, complex generics.
   - Add type stubs for untyped dependencies as needed.

4. **Verification**
   - Re-run pyright to check progress and validate fixes.
   - Use pytest to confirm no logic/test regressions.

5. **CI/CD Enforcement**
   - Integrate pyright as a required step in CI workflows.
   - Block merges on new type errors.

6. **Documentation**
   - Update developer guides/README to reflect pyright requirements and annotation standards.
   - Optionally, link common type annotation examples and references.

7. **Ongoing Compliance**
   - Document process for ongoing type safety review in PR templates and onboarding materials.
   - Assign responsibility for periodic audit and coverage improvement.

This plan delivers full static type safety via pyright, upholds modular design, and ensures code maintainability and developer clarity within CI/CD pipelines.
