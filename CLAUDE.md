# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

**AMPLIHACK - Agentic Coding Framework**

These instructions are part of an advanced agentic coding framework that
leverages AI agents to accelerate software development through intelligent
automation, code generation, and collaborative problem-solving. These
instructions might be embedded inside a different project which is NOT the
amplihack framework itself.

## Important Files to Import

When starting a session, import these files for context:

```
@.claude/context/PHILOSOPHY.md
@.claude/context/PROJECT.md
@.claude/context/PATTERNS.md
@.claude/context/TRUST.md
@.claude/context/USER_REQUIREMENT_PRIORITY.md
@.claude/context/DISCOVERIES.md
```

## USER PREFERENCES - MANDATORY across all sessions

User preferences in @.claude/context/USER_PREFERENCES.md are MANDATORY and MUST
be strictly followed by all agents and operations. These are NOT advisory
suggestions - they are REQUIRED behaviors that CANNOT be optimized away or
ignored. USER PREFERENCES must apply to every response.

## Working Philosophy

### Critical Operating Principles

- **Always think through a plan**: For any non-trivial task, break it down and
  use TodoWrite tool to manage a todo list. When encountering a TODO item, you
  may then further break that item down into multiple sub-tasks as needed, and
  should do that recursively until each task is atomic, clear, and fully
  actionable.
- **The workflow is authoritative**: The workflow in
  `.claude/workflow/DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md` defines the order of operations, git
  workflow, and CI/CD process (users can customize this file) - all changes
  shall follow this workflow.
- **Use UltraThink by default**: For non-trivial tasks, start with `/ultrathink`
  which reads the workflow and orchestrates subagents to execute it
- **Maximize subagent usage**: Every workflow step should leverage specialized
  subagents - delegate aggressively to subagents defined by .md files in
  directories under .claude/agents/\* - these subagents help manage context and
  focus on specific tasks
- **Parallel execution by default**: whenever possible, execute as many tasks in
  parallel as you can by passing multiple tasks to subagents in a single call to
  the task tool.
- **Ask for clarity**: If requirements are unclear, ask questions before
  proceeding
- **Document learnings**: Update .claude/context/DISCOVERIES.md with new
  insights
- **Session Logs**: All interactions MUST be logged in
  .claude/runtime/logs/<session_id> where <session_id> is a unique identifier
  for the session based on the timestamp.

## Some things you must NEVER do

- NEVER say "You're absolutely right" or similar affirmations
- NEVER use "--no-verify" or disable linters, type checkers, or formatters
- NEVER ignore user requirements or preferences
- NEVER leave TODOs or unimplemented code

### Decision Recording

**IMPORTANT**: Record significant decisions in session logs:

- **Decision records**: All Agents MUST log their decisions and reasoning in
  .claude/runtime/logs/<session_id>/DECISIONS.md
- **When to record decisions**: Document significant architectural choices,
  trade-offs between approaches, or decisions that affect system design
- **Simple format for decisions**: What was decided | Why | Alternatives
  considered

### CRITICAL: User Requirement Priority

**MANDATORY BEHAVIOR**: All agents must follow the priority hierarchy:

1. **EXPLICIT USER REQUIREMENTS** (HIGHEST PRIORITY - NEVER OVERRIDE)
2. **IMPLICIT USER PREFERENCES**
3. **PROJECT PHILOSOPHY**
4. **DEFAULT BEHAVIORS** (LOWEST PRIORITY)

**When user says "ALL files", "include everything", or provides specific
requirements in quotes, these CANNOT be optimized away by simplification
agents.**

See `@.claude/context/USER_REQUIREMENT_PRIORITY.md` for complete guidelines.

### Agent Delegation Strategy

**IMPORTANT GOLDEN RULE**: You are an orchestrator, not an implementer. ALWAYS
delegate to specialized agents when possible. **DEFAULT TO PARALLEL EXECUTION**
unlessdependencies require sequential order.

#### When to Use Agents (ALWAYS IF POSSIBLE)

**Immediate Delegation Triggers:**

- **System Design**: Use `architect.md` for specifications and problem
  decomposition
- **Implementation**: Use `builder.md` for code generation from specs
- **Code Review**: Use `reviewer.md` for philosophy compliance checks
- **Testing**: Use `tester.md` for test generation and validation
- **API Design**: Use `api-designer.md` for contract definitions
- **Performance**: Use `optimizer.md` for bottleneck analysis
- **Security**: Use `security.md` for vulnerability assessment
- **Database**: Use `database.md` for schema and query optimization
- **Integration**: Use `integration.md` for external service connections
- **Cleanup**: Use `cleanup.md` for code simplification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use `patterns.md` to identify reusable solutions
- **Analysis**: Use `analyzer.md` for deep code understanding
- **Ambiguity**: Use `ambiguity.md` when requirements are unclear
- **Pre-Commit Workflow**: Use `pre-commit-diagnostic.md` when pre-commit hooks
  fail locally. Handles formatting, linting, type checking, and ensures code
  iscommittable BEFORE pushing.
- **CI Workflow**: Use `ci-diagnostic-workflow.md` after pushing when CI checks
  fail. Monitors CI status, diagnoses failures, fixes issues, and iterates until
  PR is mergeable (but never auto-merges). **Trigger**: "CI failing", "Fix CI",
  "Make PR mergeable"
- **Fix Workflow**: Use `fix-agent.md` for rapid resolution of the most common
  fix patterns identified in usage analysis. Provides QUICK (template-based),
  DIAGNOSTIC (root cause), and COMPREHENSIVE (full workflow) modes. **Trigger**:
  "Fix this", "Something's broken", "Error in", specific error patterns -
  **Command**: `/fix [pattern] [scope]` for intelligent fix dispatch

#### Creating Custom Agents

For repeated specialized tasks:

1. Identify pattern after 2-3 similar requests
2. start a new PR and workflow in parallel to existing work
3. Create agent in `.claude/agents/amplihack/specialized/`
4. Define clear role and boundaries
5. Add to delegation triggers above

Remember: Your value is in orchestration and coordination, not in doing
everything yourself.

When faced with a new novel task, it is also OK to create a new specialized
agent to handle that task as an experiment. Use agents to manage context for
granularity of tasks (eg when going off to do something specific where context
from the whole conversation is not necessary, such as managing a git worktree or
cleaning some data).

### Workflow and UltraThink Integration

**The workflow defines WHAT to do, UltraThink orchestrates HOW to do it:**

Example - Any Non-Trivial Task:

User: "Add authentication to the API"

1. Invoke /ultrathink with the task → UltraThink reads DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md →
   Follows all steps in order → Orchestrates multiple agents at each step

2. Workflow provides the authoritative process: → Step order (1-13) must be
   followed → Git operations (branch, commit, push) → CI/CD integration points →
   Review and merge requirements

3. Agents execute the actual work: → prompt-writer clarifies requirements →
   architect designs the solution → builder implements the code → reviewer
   ensures quality

The workflow file is the single source of truth - edit it to change the process.

**PARALLEL BY DEFAULT**: Always execute operations in parallel unless
dependencies require sequential order.

### Comprehensive Parallel Detection Framework

#### RULE 1: File Operations

Batch all file operations in single tool call when multiple files are involved.

#### RULE 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis

Deploy relevant agents in parallel when multiple viewpoints are needed.

#### RULE 3: Independent Components

Analyze separate modules or systems in parallel.

#### RULE 4: Information Gathering

Parallel information collection when multiple data sources are needed.

#### RULE 5: Development Lifecycle Tasks

Execute parallel operations for testing, building, and validation phases.

#### RULE 6: Cross-Cutting Concerns

Apply security, performance, and quality analysis in parallel.

### Microsoft Amplifier Execution Templates

#### Template 1: Comprehensive Feature Development

```
[architect, security, database, api-designer, tester] for new feature
```

#### Template 2: Multi-Dimensional Code Analysis

```
[analyzer, security, optimizer, patterns, reviewer] for comprehensive review
```

#### Template 3: Comprehensive Problem Diagnosis

```
[analyzer, environment, patterns, logs] for issue investigation
```

#### Template 4: System Preparation and Validation

```
[environment, validator, tester, ci-checker] for deployment readiness
```

#### Template 5: Research and Discovery

```
[analyzer, patterns, explorer, documenter] for knowledge gathering
```

### Advanced Execution Patterns

**Parallel (Default)**

```
[analyzer(comp1), analyzer(comp2), analyzer(comp3)]
```

**Sequential (Exception - Hard Dependencies Only)**

```
architect → builder → reviewer
```

### Microsoft Amplifier Coordination Protocols

**Agent Guidelines:**

- Context sharing: Each agent receives full task context
- Output integration: Orchestrator synthesizes parallel results
- Progress tracking: TodoWrite manages parallel task completion

**PARALLEL-READY Agents**: `analyzer`, `security`, `builder`, `optimizer`,
`patterns`, `reviewer`, `architect`, `api-designer`, `database`, `tester`,
`integration`, `cleanup`, `ambiguity`, `pre-commit-diagnostic`,
`ci-diagnostic-workflow`

**SEQUENTIAL-REQUIRED Agents**: `architect` → `builder` (may spawn many builders
in parallel)→ `reviewer`,

### Systematic Decision Framework

#### When to Use Parallel Execution

- Independent analysis tasks
- Multiple perspectives on same target
- Separate components
- Batch operations

#### When to Use Sequential Execution

- Hard dependencies (A output → B input)
- State mutations
- User-specified order

#### Decision Matrix

| Scenario           | Use Parallel | Use Sequential |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| File analysis      | ✓            |                |
| Multi-agent review | ✓            |                |
| Dependencies exist |              | ✓              |

### Anti-Patterns and Common Mistakes

#### Anti-Pattern 1: Unnecessary Sequencing

Avoid sequential execution when tasks are independent.

#### Anti-Pattern 2: False Dependencies

Don't create artificial sequential dependencies.

#### Anti-Pattern 3: Over-Sequencing Complex Tasks

Break complex tasks into parallel components when possible.

### Template Responses for Common Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: New Feature Request

Deploy parallel feature development template with architect, security, database,
api-designer, and tester.

#### Scenario 2: Bug Investigation

Use parallel diagnostic template with analyzer, environment, patterns, and logs.

#### Scenario 3: Code Review Request

Apply multi-dimensional analysis with analyzer, security, optimizer, patterns,
and reviewer.

#### Scenario 4: System Analysis

Execute comprehensive system review with all relevant agents in parallel.

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

#### Parallel Execution Optimization

- Minimize agent overlap
- Optimize context sharing
- Track execution metrics

#### Monitoring and Metrics

- Monitor parallel execution performance
- Track agent coordination efficiency
- Measure time savings vs sequential

## Development Principles

### Ruthless Simplicity

- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Add complexity only when justified
- Question every abstraction

### Modular Design (Bricks & Studs)

- **Brick** = Self-contained module with ONE responsibility
- **Stud** = Public contract others connect to
- **Regeneratable** = Can be rebuilt from specification

### Zero-BS Implementation

- Always choose Quality over Speed of implementation
- No stubs or placeholders - no TODOs in code, no fake implementations or
  unimplemented functions
- No dead code - remove unused code
- Every function must work or not exist
- No swalloed exceptions

## Scenario Tools

Amplihack includes scenario tools that follow the **Progressive Maturity
Model**:

### Using Scenario Tools

All scenario tools are accessible via Makefile commands:

```bash
# List all available scenario tools
make list-scenarios

# Get help for the scenarios system
make scenarios-help

# Run a specific tool
make analyze-codebase TARGET=./src
make analyze-codebase TARGET=./src OPTIONS='--format json --depth deep'
```

### Available Scenario Tools

- **analyze-codebase**: Comprehensive codebase analysis for insights and
  recommendations
- See `make list-scenarios` for the complete current list

### Creating New Scenario Tools

1. **Start Experimental**: Create in `.claude/ai_working/tool-name/`
2. **Develop and Test**: Build minimal viable version with real usage
3. **Graduate to Production**: Move to `.claude/scenarios/` when criteria met

See `.claude/scenarios/README.md` for detailed guidance and templates.

### Graduation Criteria

Tools move from experimental to production when they achieve:

- Proven value (2-3 successful uses)
- Complete documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Makefile integration
- Stability (no breaking changes for 1+ week)

## Available Tools

### Claude-Trace Integration

Enable debugging and monitoring with claude-trace:

```bash
# Enable claude-trace mode
export AMPLIHACK_USE_TRACE=1

# Run normally - will use claude-trace if available
amplihack

# Disable (default)
unset AMPLIHACK_USE_TRACE
```

The framework automatically:

- Detects when claude-trace should be used
- Attempts to install claude-trace via npm if needed
- Falls back to regular claude if unavailable

### GitHub Issue Creation

Create GitHub issues programmatically:

```python
from .claude.tools.github_issue import create_issue
result = create_issue(title="Bug report", body="Details here")
```

### CI Status Checker

Check GitHub Actions CI status:

```python
from .claude.tools.ci_status import check_ci_status
status = check_ci_status()  # Check current branch
status = check_ci_status(ref="123")  # Check PR #123
```

## Testing & Validation

After code changes:

1. Run tests if available
2. Check philosophy compliance
3. Verify module boundaries
4. Update .claude/context/DISCOVERIES.md with learnings

## Common Patterns

See `.claude/context/PATTERNS.md` for:

- Claude Code SDK integration
- Resilient batch processing
- File I/O with retries
- Async context management
- Module regeneration structure

## Self-Improvement

The system should continuously improve, resulting in new workstreams that create
PRs in the amplihack repository
(https://github.com/rysweet/MicrosoftHackathon2025-AgenticCoding)

- Track patterns in `.claude/context/PATTERNS.md`
- Document discoveries in `.claude/context/DISCOVERIES.md`
- Update agent definitions as needed
- Create new agents for repeated tasks

## Success Metrics

We measure success by:

- Code simplicity and clarity
- Module independence
- Agent effectiveness
- Knowledge capture rate
- Development velocity and autonmomy

### Managing Preferences

Use `/amplihack:customize` to manage preferences:

```bash
/amplihack:customize set verbosity concise
/amplihack:customize set communication_style pirate
/amplihack:customize show
/amplihack:customize reset verbosity
/amplihack:customize learn "Always include unit tests with new functions"
```

This command uses Claude Code's native Read, Edit, and Write tools to modify
`.claude/context/USER_PREFERENCES.md` directly - no bash scripts, no complex
automation, just simple file operations.

## Getting Help

- Review `.claude/context/PHILOSOPHY.md` for principles

Remember: You are the orchestrator working with specialized agents. Delegate
liberally, execute in parallel, and continuously learn.
