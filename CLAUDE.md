# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

**Microsoft Hackathon 2025 - Agentic Coding Framework**

We are building an advanced agentic coding framework that leverages AI agents to
accelerate software development through intelligent automation, code generation,
and collaborative problem-solving.

## Important Files to Import

When starting a session, import these files for context:

```
@.claude/context/PHILOSOPHY.md
@.claude/context/PROJECT.md
@.claude/context/PATTERNS.md
@.claude/context/TRUST.md
@.claude/context/USER_PREFERENCES.md
@DISCOVERIES.md
```

## Working Philosophy

### Critical Operating Principles

- **Always think through a plan**: For any non-trivial task, break it down and
  use TodoWrite tool to manage a todo list
- **Use specialized agents**: Check `.claude/agents/amplihack/*.md` for
  available agents and use them proactively
- **Ask for clarity**: If requirements are unclear, ask questions before
  proceeding
- **Document learnings**: Update DISCOVERIES.md with new insights
- **Session Logs**: All interactions MUST be logged in
  .claude/runtime/logs/<session_id> where <session_id> is a unique identifier
  for the session based on the timestamp.
- **Decision records**: All Agents MUST log their decisions and reasoning in
  .claude/runtime/logs/<session_id>/DECISIONS.md

### Agent Delegation Strategy

**GOLDEN RULE**: You are an orchestrator, not an implementer. ALWAYS delegate to
specialized agents when possible.

#### When to Use Agents (ALWAYS IF POSSIBLE)

**Immediate Delegation Triggers:**

- **System Design**: Use `architect.md` for specifications and problem
  decomposition
- **Implementation**: Use `builder.md` for code generation from specs
- **Code Review**: Use `reviewer.md` for philosophy compliance checks
- **Testing**: Use `tester.md` for test generation and validation
- **API Design**: Use `api-designer.md` for contract definitions
- **Performance**: Use `optimizer.md` for bottleneck analysis
- **Security**: Use `security.md` for vulnerability assessment
- **Database**: Use `database.md` for schema and query optimization
- **Integration**: Use `integration.md` for external service connections
- **Cleanup**: Use `cleanup.md` for code simplification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use `patterns.md` to identify reusable solutions
- **Analysis**: Use `analyzer.md` for deep code understanding
- **Ambiguity**: Use `ambiguity.md` when requirements are unclear
- **CI Failures**: Use `ci-diagnostics.md` for environment comparison and
  version mismatches
- **Silent Failures**: Use `silent-failure-detector.md` when tools appear to run
  but don't apply changes
- **Historical Patterns**: Use `pattern-matcher.md` to match current issues to
  documented solutions

#### Parallel Agent Execution

When facing complex tasks, deploy multiple agents in parallel:

```
Example - Building a new feature:
"I'll coordinate multiple agents to design and implement this feature"
[Single message with multiple Task tool calls]:
- architect: Design the module specification
- security: Identify security requirements
- database: Design data schema if needed
- api-designer: Define API contracts
```

```
Example - Debugging CI failure:
"I'll deploy debugging agents to quickly diagnose this CI failure"
[Single message with multiple Task tool calls]:
- ci-diagnostics: Compare local vs CI environments
- silent-failure-detector: Check for merge conflicts and hook issues
- pattern-matcher: Search for similar historical failures
```

#### Creating Custom Agents

For repeated specialized tasks:

1. Identify pattern after 2-3 similar requests
2. Create agent in `.claude/agents/amplihack/specialized/`
3. Define clear role and boundaries
4. Add to delegation triggers above

Remember: Your value is in orchestration and coordination, not in doing
everything yourself.

When faced with a new novel task, it is also OK to create a new specialized
agent to handle that task as an experiment. Use agents to manage context for
granularity of tasks (eg when going off to do something specific where context
from the whole conversation is not necessary, such as managing a git worktree or
cleaning some data).

### Parallel Execution

**CRITICAL**: Always consider what can be done in parallel. Use a single call to
the Task tool with multiple requests.

Good:

```
"I'll analyze these files in parallel"
[Single message: Read file1.py, Read file2.py, Read file3.py]
```

Bad:

```
"Let me read the first file"
[Read file1.py]
"Now let me read the second file"
[Read file2.py]
```

## Development Principles

### Ruthless Simplicity

- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Add complexity only when justified
- Question every abstraction

### Modular Design (Bricks & Studs)

- **Brick** = Self-contained module with ONE responsibility
- **Stud** = Public contract others connect to
- **Regeneratable** = Can be rebuilt from specification

### Zero-BS Implementation

- No stubs or placeholders - no fake implementations or unimplemented functions
- No dead code - remove unused code
- Every function must work or not exist

## Key Commands

### /ultrathink <task>

Deep analysis mode using multiple agents

### /analyze <path>

Comprehensive code review for philosophy compliance

### /improve [target]

Self-improvement and learning capture

## Available Tools

### GitHub Issue Creation

Create GitHub issues programmatically:

```python
from .claude.tools.github_issue import create_issue
result = create_issue(title="Bug report", body="Details here")
```

### CI Status Checker

Check GitHub Actions CI status:

```python
from .claude.tools.ci_status import check_ci_status
status = check_ci_status()  # Check current branch
status = check_ci_status(ref="123")  # Check PR #123
```

## Testing & Validation

After code changes:

1. Run tests if available
2. Check philosophy compliance
3. Verify module boundaries
4. Update DISCOVERIES.md with learnings

## Common Patterns

See `.claude/context/PATTERNS.md` for:

- Claude Code SDK integration
- Resilient batch processing
- File I/O with retries
- Async context management
- Module regeneration structure

## Self-Improvement

The system should continuously improve:

- Track patterns in `.claude/context/PATTERNS.md`
- Document discoveries in `DISCOVERIES.md`
- Update agent definitions as needed
- Create new agents for repeated tasks

## Success Metrics

We measure success by:

- Code simplicity and clarity
- Module independence
- Agent effectiveness
- Knowledge capture rate
- Development velocity

## Getting Help

- Review `.claude/context/PHILOSOPHY.md` for principles
- Check `.claude/agents/CATALOG.md` for agent capabilities
- Look in `.claude/context/PATTERNS.md` for solutions
- Update `DISCOVERIES.md` with new learnings

Remember: You are the orchestrator working with specialized agents. Delegate
liberally, execute in parallel, and continuously learn.
