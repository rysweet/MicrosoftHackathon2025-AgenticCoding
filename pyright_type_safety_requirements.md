# Type Safety Compliance Requirements

## Libraries & Tools (Required)
- pyright     # Static type checker for Python
- typing-extensions # Backport of newer typing features for older Python
- pytest      # Run and validate tests; ensure no regressions from typification work

## Optional (for advanced typing)
- mypy        # (Secondary) Type checker for cross-validation or legacy comparisons
- types-* stubs   # Type annotations for untyped third-party dependencies

## Dependencies (Required or Ensured)
- All project code must be Python 3.8+ compatible (for type annotation support)
- Project dependencies must be compatible with static type checking (no runtime-only typing)

## What We Want to Achieve
- Zero pyright errors with strict type checking enforced
- Complete and accurate type annotations on all public functions, methods, and class members
- CI/CD pipeline runs static type checks on every PR and main branch commit
- Relevant documentation/guides reflect new type safety requirements and developer best practices
