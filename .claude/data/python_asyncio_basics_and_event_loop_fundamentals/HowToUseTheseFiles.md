# How To Use These Files

Generated: 2025-10-18 14:34:34

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive knowledge base about **Python asyncio basics and event loop fundamentals** organized into 5 files:

1. **Knowledge.md** - Visual knowledge graph with mermaid diagram and question hierarchy
2. **Triplets.md** - Structured fact triplets in (Subject, Predicate, Object) format
3. **KeyInfo.md** - Executive summary with key concepts and statistics
4. **Sources.md** - All web sources used, organized by domain
5. **HowToUseTheseFiles.md** - This file

## Quick Start

### For Quick Overview

Start with **KeyInfo.md** to get the executive summary and core concepts.

### For Deep Understanding

Read **Knowledge.md** to explore the full question hierarchy and see how concepts build on each other.

### For Fact Extraction

Use **Triplets.md** to extract structured facts in a machine-readable format.

### For Research

Check **Sources.md** to find all original web sources, organized by domain.

### For Visual Learners

The mermaid diagram in **Knowledge.md** shows the conceptual structure at a glance.

## Structure

The knowledge is organized using the Socratic method:

- **Depth 0**: 10 fundamental questions establishing core understanding
- **Depth 1**: 30 follow-up questions (3 per initial question) challenging assumptions
- **Depth 2**: 90 deeper questions (3 per depth-1) exploring implications
- **Depth 3**: ~140 deepest questions testing logical consistency

Total: ~270 questions with answers backed by web research.

## Integration

### Using with Claude Code

```bash
# Search for specific concepts
grep -r "your concept" .

# Count questions by depth
grep "depth" Knowledge.md | sort | uniq -c

# Extract all URLs
grep -h "http" Sources.md | sort | uniq
```

### Using with Python

```python
# Parse triplets for knowledge graph
import re

with open("Triplets.md") as f:
    content = f.read()
    # Extract triplets from markdown table
    # Process with your knowledge graph library
```

## Regeneration

This knowledge base was generated by the Knowledge Builder agent. To regenerate or update:

```bash
/amplihack:knowledge-builder "Python asyncio basics and event loop fundamentals"
```

## Notes

- All answers are backed by web search results
- Sources are cited and can be verified
- The Socratic structure helps identify gaps in understanding
