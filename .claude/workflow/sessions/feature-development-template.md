# Feature Development Session Template

**Target Exchanges**: 5-8 exchanges
**Session Type**: Feature Development

## Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture (Exchange 1-2)

### Comprehensive Requirement Gathering
**Complete ALL requirements gathering in first exchange:**

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - What exactly should the feature do?
   - What user interactions are involved?
   - What inputs/outputs are expected?
   - What business logic is required?

2. **Technical Constraints**
   - What existing systems must it integrate with?
   - What performance requirements exist?
   - What security considerations apply?
   - What compatibility requirements exist?

3. **Scope Boundaries**
   - What IS included in this feature?
   - What is explicitly NOT included?
   - What dependencies exist on other features?
   - What can be done in parallel vs sequentially?

### Architecture Planning (Exchange 2)
- **System Design**: Component breakdown and interactions
- **Database Schema**: Data model and relationships
- **API Contracts**: Input/output specifications
- **Security Model**: Authentication and authorization
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E test approach

## Phase 2: Implementation (Exchange 3-5)

### Development Execution
- **Parallel Development**: Components that can be built simultaneously
- **Critical Path**: Dependencies that must be completed sequentially
- **Milestone Markers**: Clear completion criteria for each component

### Quality Assurance
- **Test Implementation**: As code is developed
- **Code Review**: Integrated into development process
- **Integration Testing**: Continuous validation

## Phase 3: Validation & Deployment (Exchange 6-8)

### Final Integration
- **System Integration**: All components working together
- **Performance Validation**: Meets non-functional requirements
- **Security Review**: Security requirements satisfied

### Deployment Preparation
- **Documentation**: Complete and accurate
- **Deployment Plan**: Clear rollout strategy
- **Rollback Plan**: If issues are discovered

## Success Criteria

**Session Complete When**:
- ✅ All functional requirements implemented
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Code reviewed and approved
- ✅ Performance requirements met
- ✅ Security requirements satisfied
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Ready for deployment

## Efficiency Optimizations

### Context Preservation
- **Decision Log**: All architectural decisions with rationale
- **Assumption Register**: All assumptions made explicit
- **Change Impact**: How modifications affect other systems

### Parallel Work Identification
- **Independent Components**: Can be developed simultaneously
- **Shared Resources**: Need coordination
- **Integration Points**: Require synchronization

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: Complexity, dependencies, unknowns
- **Timeline Risks**: Critical path bottlenecks
- **Quality Risks**: Testing coverage, integration issues

This template ensures comprehensive upfront planning that eliminates 80% of clarification cycles while maintaining high-quality deliverables.
