# Quick Clarification Session Template

**Target Exchanges**: 2-3 exchanges
**Session Type**: Quick Clarification

## Phase 1: Scope Control (Exchange 1)

### Immediate Boundary Setting

**Define exactly what needs clarification:**

1. **Specific Question**
   - What exactly do you need to understand?
   - Is this about how something works or how to do something?
   - What level of detail is needed (overview vs deep technical)?
   - What's the context for needing this information?

2. **Scope Limitation**
   - Are you looking for explanation only or implementation guidance?
   - Should this stay conceptual or include specific examples?
   - Is this a one-time question or part of a larger task?
   - What related topics should be explicitly excluded?

3. **Output Format**
   - Do you need a quick answer or comprehensive explanation?
   - Should examples be included?
   - Is this for immediate use or future reference?
   - Any specific format preferences (bullet points, narrative, code examples)?

## Phase 2: Complete Response (Exchange 2)

### Comprehensive Answer

- **Direct Answer**: Address the specific question clearly
- **Context**: Provide necessary background information
- **Examples**: Include relevant examples if requested
- **Caveats**: Note any limitations or exceptions

### Preemptive Clarification

- **Common Follow-ups**: Address likely next questions
- **Related Information**: Include relevant adjacent information
- **Edge Cases**: Mention important exceptions or special cases
- **Further Resources**: Point to additional information sources if needed

## Phase 3: Validation (Exchange 3 - if needed)

### Confirmation

- **Understanding Check**: Verify the explanation was clear
- **Application Guidance**: Provide guidance on how to apply the information
- **Next Steps**: Suggest logical next steps if applicable

## Success Criteria

**Clarification Complete When**:

- ✅ Original question fully answered
- ✅ Appropriate level of detail provided
- ✅ Examples included where helpful
- ✅ Context and caveats explained
- ✅ No obvious follow-up questions remain
- ✅ User can apply the information

## Efficiency Optimizations

### Front-Loading Information

- **Anticipate Follow-ups**: Address likely next questions in initial response
- **Provide Context**: Include enough background to prevent confusion
- **Use Examples**: Concrete examples prevent misunderstanding
- **Define Terms**: Clarify any technical terms used

### Scope Management

- **Stay Focused**: Don't expand beyond the specific question
- **Prevent Scope Creep**: Politely redirect if questions expand
- **Clear Boundaries**: Be explicit about what's included/excluded
- **Time Boxing**: Keep responses appropriately sized

### Context Preservation

- **Self-Contained**: Response should be understandable without re-reading conversation
- **Reference Materials**: Include links or references for deeper exploration
- **Application Notes**: How to practically use the information provided

This template ensures efficient clarification through focused scope control and comprehensive initial responses.
