# Quick Clarification Session Template

## Session Efficiency Target: 2-3 exchanges

This template handles rapid clarification and small tasks that risk expanding into long conversations without proper boundaries.

## When to Use This Template

Apply this template for:

- **Simple Questions**: That could expand into analysis sessions
- **Quick Tasks**: Small changes that need clear boundaries
- **Clarification Requests**: About existing code or decisions
- **Documentation Updates**: Limited scope documentation needs
- **Configuration Changes**: Simple settings or parameter adjustments

## Pre-Session Checklist

Before engaging:

- [ ] Confirm this is truly a quick task (< 30 minutes work)
- [ ] Identify exact scope boundaries
- [ ] Determine if broader context is needed
- [ ] Set clear success criteria

## Exchange Flow Template

### Exchange 1: Scope Definition and Information Gathering

**Goal**: Define exact boundaries and gather all necessary context

```
I want to ensure we handle this efficiently. Let me clarify the exact scope:

**Quick Scope Assessment:**
1. What is the specific question or task? (exact boundaries)
2. What context do you need? (understanding vs implementation)
3. What would constitute a complete answer?
4. Is this part of a larger task, or standalone?
5. What would make this answer most useful to you?

**Context Boundaries:**
6. Do you need background explanation, or just the direct answer?
7. Should I include related considerations or focus narrowly?
8. Are there specific constraints or preferences for the response?
9. Is this for immediate use or future reference?

**Success Criteria:**
10. How will you know this clarification is sufficient?
11. What would require follow-up vs what closes this topic?
```

### Exchange 2: Comprehensive Response

**Goal**: Provide complete answer within defined scope

````
## [Question/Task Title]

### Direct Answer
[Focused response to exact question asked]

### Context (As Requested)
**Background**: [Only if scope included background]
**Relevant Details**: [Within specified boundaries]
**Related Considerations**: [Only if requested in scope]

### Implementation (If Applicable)
**Immediate Steps**:
1. [Action 1 with specific details]
2. [Action 2 with specific details]
3. [Validation step]

**Code/Configuration**:
```[language]
[Exact code or configuration needed]
````

### Boundaries Maintained

**What's Included**: [Confirms scope from Exchange 1]
**What's Not Included**: [Explicitly out of scope]
**Related Topics**: [Available for separate questions if needed]

### Success Validation

**Your Success Criteria** (from Exchange 1):

- [Criterion 1]: ✓ Addressed
- [Criterion 2]: ✓ Addressed

**This clarification is complete unless**: [Specific conditions for follow-up]

```

### Exchange 3: Confirmation and Closure (If Needed)

**Goal**: Confirm understanding and close cleanly

```

## Clarification Confirmation

**Understanding Check**:

- Does this answer your specific question?
- Is the scope appropriate for your needs?
- Any critical gaps in the response?

**Clean Closure**:

- This clarification addresses: [original question]
- For broader topics: [suggest separate focused sessions]
- For follow-up questions: [encourage specific new questions]

**Session Complete**: [Clear closure statement]

```

## Efficiency Techniques for Quick Sessions

### Scope Control Strategies
- **Narrow Focus**: Resist expanding scope without explicit request
- **Boundary Setting**: Clearly define what's included/excluded
- **Context Limiting**: Provide only requested level of detail
- **Future Separation**: Acknowledge related topics without addressing them

### Information Architecture
- **Layered Response**: Direct answer first, context second
- **Scannable Format**: Easy to find the specific information needed
- **Reference Quality**: Suitable for future reference without re-explanation

### Expansion Prevention
- **Explicit Boundaries**: State what's not included
- **Separate Session Offers**: Suggest focused sessions for broader topics
- **Question Discipline**: Answer what was asked, not what might be implied

## Common Quick Session Types

### Code Explanation
```

Exchange 1: What specific part needs explanation? What level of detail?
Exchange 2: Focused explanation with just the necessary context
Exchange 3: Confirmation of understanding (if needed)

```

### Configuration Help
```

Exchange 1: Exact configuration need and environment context
Exchange 2: Specific configuration with implementation steps
Exchange 3: Validation or troubleshooting (if needed)

```

### Decision Clarification
```

Exchange 1: What decision needs clarity? What context helps?
Exchange 2: Decision reasoning and implications within scope
Exchange 3: Confirmation the reasoning is clear

```

### Quick Implementation
```

Exchange 1: Exact change needed, constraints, success criteria
Exchange 2: Implementation with focused validation
Exchange 3: Confirmation and any immediate issues

```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Scope Creep Indicators
- Adding "while we're at it" tasks
- Explaining broader architectural decisions without request
- Implementing related improvements not specifically asked for
- Providing comprehensive analysis when simple answer requested

### Conversation Expansion Traps
- Answering implied questions not explicitly asked
- Providing too much context "just in case"
- Opening discussion of related design decisions
- Starting broader code review during simple explanation

### Efficiency Killers
- Asking for clarification of clear, simple requests
- Providing multiple alternative approaches for straightforward tasks
- Deep-diving into edge cases not relevant to immediate need
- Requiring additional exchanges for simple confirmations

## Success Metrics

- **Exchange Count**: Target 2-3, Maximum 4
- **Scope Adherence**: 100% stay within defined boundaries
- **Question Resolution**: Complete answer to exact question asked
- **Future Reference**: Response quality suitable for later use without follow-up
- **Clean Closure**: Clear end point without loose threads

## Session Escalation

### When to Escalate to Full Session
Indicators that this needs a full planning session:
- Scope expands beyond simple clarification
- Multiple related questions emerge
- Implementation affects multiple components
- Architectural decisions required
- Complex testing or validation needed

### Escalation Process
```

I notice this is expanding beyond quick clarification into [broader topic].
Let me suggest we use a full planning session to address this comprehensively:

1. [Current question]: [Simple answer within current scope]
2. [Broader topics]: Best addressed in dedicated session with proper planning
3. [Suggested approach]: [How to structure the fuller session]

Would you like to close this clarification and start a focused session on [broader topic]?

```

## Template Adaptation

### For Different Complexity Levels

#### Ultra-Simple (1-2 exchanges)
- Direct question with obvious answer
- No context or implementation needed
- Clear success criteria

#### Simple (2-3 exchanges)
- Some context helpful
- Minor implementation or configuration
- Straightforward validation

#### Boundary Case (3-4 exchanges)
- Multiple related clarifications
- Implementation with validation
- Some complexity but still bounded

Remember: The goal is efficient resolution of specific questions without expanding into larger analysis or implementation sessions. Maintain focus and boundaries while providing complete answers within the defined scope.
