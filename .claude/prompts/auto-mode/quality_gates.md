# Auto-Mode Quality Gates

## Purpose

Quality gates define the criteria and thresholds for auto-mode interventions, ensuring that suggestions and actions are valuable, timely, and appropriate.

## Gate Categories

### 1. Intervention Threshold Gates

Determine when auto-mode should suggest interventions.

#### Gate: Conversation Quality Drop

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - quality_score < 0.6
  - consecutive_low_quality_exchanges >= 3
  - user_confusion_signals >= 2

evaluation_criteria:
  - clarity_score: weight=0.3, threshold=0.5
  - effectiveness_score: weight=0.4, threshold=0.6
  - user_satisfaction: weight=0.3, threshold=0.7

intervention_actions:
  - suggest_clarification_questions
  - recommend_different_approach
  - offer_topic_restructuring
```

#### Gate: Goal Achievement Stagnation

```yaml

  - no_new_information_gained for 5+ exchanges

evaluation_criteria:
  - progress_velocity: threshold=0.1
  - solution_diversity: threshold=0.3
  - user_engagement: threshold=0.6

intervention_actions:
  - suggest_alternative_tools

```

### 2. Learning Opportunity Gates

Identify when auto-mode should capture insights or preferences.

#### Gate: Pattern Recognition

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - pattern_occurrence_count >= 3

```

#### Gate: Optimization Opportunity

```yaml
trigger_conditions:

  - user_workflow_repetition >= 2
  - tool_usage_suboptimal for task_type

evaluation_criteria:
  - time_savings_potential: threshold=0.2
  - user_skill_level_appropriate: threshold=0.8
  - change_complexity: threshold=0.4

optimization_actions:
  - suggest_workflow_improvement
  - recommend_tool_sequence
  - offer_automation_opportunity
```

### 3. Safety and Privacy Gates

Ensure auto-mode operations respect boundaries and maintain security.

#### Gate: Privacy Protection

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - sensitive_data_detected in conversation
  - external_service_integration_required
  - user_personal_information_involved

evaluation_criteria:
  - data_sensitivity_level: threshold="medium"
  - user_consent_status: required=true
  - regulatory_compliance: required=true

protection_actions:
  - request_explicit_permission
  - anonymize_sensitive_data
  - limit_external_sharing
```

#### Gate: User Autonomy Respect

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - user_expressed_preference against automation
  - user_learning_mode_detected
  - creative_or_exploratory_task_type

evaluation_criteria:
  - user_control_preference: threshold="high"
  - task_exploration_value: threshold=0.7
  - learning_opportunity: threshold=0.6

respect_actions:
  - minimize_interventions
  - offer_optional_assistance
  - prioritize_educational_suggestions
```

### 4. Technical Quality Gates

Ensure technical accuracy and appropriateness of suggestions.

#### Gate: Solution Accuracy

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - technical_solution_confidence < 0.8
  - domain_expertise_mismatch detected
  - unverified_approach_suggested

evaluation_criteria:
  - solution_validity: threshold=0.9
  - domain_appropriateness: threshold=0.8
  - risk_assessment: threshold="low"

quality_actions:
  - verify_solution_accuracy
  - seek_expert_validation
  - provide_uncertainty_disclosure
```

#### Gate: Tool Appropriateness

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - tool_suggestion_confidence < 0.7
  - user_tool_familiarity < 0.5
  - complex_tool_for_simple_task

evaluation_criteria:
  - tool_task_fit: threshold=0.8
  - user_skill_alignment: threshold=0.6
  - complexity_appropriateness: threshold=0.7

appropriateness_actions:
  - suggest_simpler_alternatives
  - provide_tool_education
  - offer_guided_tool_usage
```

## Gate Evaluation Process

### 1. Continuous Monitoring

```python
# Pseudo-code for gate evaluation
def evaluate_quality_gates(conversation_state, analysis_results):
    gate_results = {}

    for gate in active_quality_gates:
        conditions_met = check_trigger_conditions(gate, conversation_state)
        if conditions_met:
            criteria_scores = evaluate_criteria(gate, analysis_results)
            if all_criteria_pass(criteria_scores, gate.thresholds):
                gate_results[gate.name] = {
                    'triggered': True,
                    'actions': gate.actions,
                    'confidence': calculate_confidence(criteria_scores),
                    'priority': gate.priority
                }

    return prioritize_actions(gate_results)
```

### 2. Action Prioritization

Priority levels for conflicting gate actions:

1. **Safety/Privacy**: Always highest priority
2. **User Autonomy**: High priority, respect user preferences
3. **Quality Issues**: Medium-high priority for conversation health
4. **Optimization**: Medium priority for efficiency gains
5. **Learning**: Low-medium priority for future improvements

### 3. Threshold Calibration

Thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on:

- User feedback on intervention quality
- Success rates of previous suggestions
- Context-specific factors (task complexity, user expertise)
- Historical conversation patterns

## Gate Configuration

### User-Customizable Parameters

```yaml
user_preferences:
  intervention_frequency: "minimal|balanced|active"
  suggestion_confidence_threshold: 0.7 # 0.0-1.0
  privacy_protection_level: "strict|balanced|permissive"
  learning_rate: "slow|normal|aggressive"

  custom_gates:
    - name: "my_domain_expertise"
      conditions: ["domain:machine_learning", "confidence<0.9"]
      actions: ["request_verification"]
```

### Adaptive Learning

Gates learn and improve through:

- User acceptance/rejection of suggestions
- Outcome effectiveness measurement
- Conversation quality improvements
- User satisfaction feedback

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Gate Performance Metrics

- **Trigger Accuracy**: How often triggered gates lead to valuable interventions
- **User Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of suggestions accepted by users
- **Quality Improvement**: Measurable conversation quality gains
- **False Positive Rate**: Inappropriate interventions triggered

### Continuous Improvement

- Weekly threshold optimization based on performance data
- Monthly gate effectiveness reviews
- Quarterly user satisfaction assessments
- Annual gate architecture evaluations
