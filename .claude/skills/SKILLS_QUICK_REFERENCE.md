**Status**: ‚è≥ Planned (Phase 2)

---

## Research & Learning

### Researching Topics
**Triggers**: "how does X work", "what is Y", unfamiliar terms, need info
**Does**: Quick web research, synthesis, key concepts, actionable summary
**Invokes**: WebSearch + synthesis
**Escalates**: /knowledge-builder for deep dive
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### Explaining Concepts
**Triggers**: "explain", "what is", "how does", learning requests
**Does**: Progressive explanations, ELI5 to deep dive, builds mental models
**Invokes**: Teaching methodology
**Status**: ‚è≥ Planned (Phase 3)

### Building Knowledge
**Triggers**: Documentation tasks, "document this", knowledge gaps
**Does**: Quick documentation generation (lighter than /knowledge-builder)
**Invokes**: Simplified knowledge-builder workflow
**Escalates**: /knowledge-builder for comprehensive research
**Status**: ‚è≥ Planned (Phase 3)

---

## Meta-Cognitive

### Analyzing Problems Deeply
**Triggers**: "I'm not sure", "help me think", ambiguity, complex problems
**Does**: Structured deep analysis, surfaces assumptions, explores options
**Invokes**: Ultrathink methodology
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### Evaluating Tradeoffs
**Triggers**: "should I use X or Y", "which approach", decision points
**Does**: Multi-perspective tradeoff analysis, systematic comparison
**Invokes**: Consensus/debate workflow
**Status**: ‚è≥ Planned (Phase 3)

---

## Collaboration

### Creating Pull Requests
**Triggers**: "create PR", "ready to merge", "make pull request"
**Does**: Analyzes commits, generates comprehensive PR description, creates PR
**Invokes**: Git analysis + gh CLI
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### Writing RFCs
**Triggers**: "design doc", "RFC", major architectural changes
**Does**: Structured RFC creation with template, architecture documentation
**Invokes**: RFC template + Architect agent
**Status**: ‚è≥ Planned (Phase 3)

## Quick Comparison: Skills vs Slash Commands

| Situation | Use Skill (Auto) | Use Command (Explicit) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Design question | Architecting Solutions | /ultrathink (deeper) |
| Quick research | Researching Topics | /knowledge-builder (comprehensive) |
| Code review | Reviewing Code | /review --custom-rules |
| Need tests | Testing Code | Manual test writing |
| Create PR | Creating Pull Requests | Manual PR creation |
| Complex decision | Analyzing Deeply | /consensus (multi-stakeholder) |

## Activation Examples

### Example 1: Architecture
```
You: "I'm building a chat app. Should I use WebSockets or polling?"

Auto-Activates: Architecting Solutions skill
Provides: Problem analysis, solution options (WebSockets, long-polling, SSE),
          tradeoff analysis, recommendation with justification
```

### Example 2: Research
```
You: "What's the difference between JWT and session tokens?"

Auto-Activates: Researching Topics skill
Provides: Quick overview, key differences, security implications,
          use case recommendations
Suggests: /knowledge-builder for deep dive
```

### Example 3: Code Review
```
You: "Review this authentication code before I commit."

Auto-Activates: Reviewing Code skill
Provides: Security analysis, finds timing attack vulnerability,
          suggests fixes, checks test coverage
```

### Example 4: Deep Analysis
```
You: "I'm not sure whether to use PostgreSQL or MongoDB."

Auto-Activates: Analyzing Problems Deeply skill
Provides: Problem decomposition, multi-perspective analysis,
          assumption surfacing, tradeoff matrix, clear recommendation
```

## When Skills Don't Activate

If a skill doesn't activate when you expect:

1. **Be more explicit**: "Design this architecture" vs "I need to build X"
2. **Use trigger phrases**: Check skill's "When to Activate" section
3. **Use slash command**: Explicit control when auto-detection misses
4. **File issue**: Help improve trigger matching

## Disabling Skills

If you prefer manual control:

**Per-Task**: Ignore skill activation and proceed with manual approach
**Per-Project**: Create `.claude/config` with `skills: disabled`
**Permanently**: User settings in `~/.claude/config`

**Pro Tip**: Skills work best when you describe what you're trying to do in natural language. Don't try to "trigger" skills - just explain your needs and let them activate automatically.

**Remember**: Skills complement, not replace, slash commands. Use whichever is most natural for your workflow.
