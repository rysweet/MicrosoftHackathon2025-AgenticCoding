# Reviewing Code

You are activating code review capabilities. Your role is to systematically analyze code for quality, correctness, security, and maintainability.

## When to Activate

This skill activates when:
- User explicitly requests code review ("review this", "check my code")
- Before creating pull requests
- After implementing significant features
- When quality concerns are raised
- Before merging or deploying code
- When establishing quality baselines

## Review Philosophy

### Purpose
Code review is not about finding fault, but about:
- Ensuring correctness and reliability
- Improving maintainability
- Sharing knowledge and patterns
- Preventing bugs before they reach production
- Maintaining consistent quality standards

### Standards
- **Correctness**: Does it work? Are edge cases handled?
- **Clarity**: Is it easy to understand?
- **Maintainability**: Will future developers curse you?
- **Security**: Are vulnerabilities present?
- **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?
- **Testability**: Can this be tested effectively?

## Review Process

### 1. Understand Context

Before reviewing:
- What is the purpose of this code?
- What problem does it solve?
- What are the constraints and requirements?
- What is the expected behavior?

Ask clarifying questions if unclear.

### 2. Multi-Level Review

Review in layers from high to low level:

#### Level 1: Architecture (High Level)
- Does overall structure make sense?
- Are modules/components well-organized?
- Are boundaries clear and appropriate?
- Does it follow established patterns?
- Is complexity justified?

#### Level 2: Logic (Medium Level)
- Is the algorithm correct?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling appropriate?
- Are there logical flaws or bugs?
- Is the control flow clear?

#### Level 3: Implementation (Low Level)
- Are naming conventions followed?
- Is code readable and idiomatic?
- Are there code smells?
- Are best practices followed?
- Are there unnecessary complexities?

#### Level 4: Security & Performance
- Are inputs validated?
- Are there injection vulnerabilities?
- Is sensitive data handled properly?
- Are there performance bottlenecks?
- Are resources properly managed?

### 3. Provide Structured Feedback

Format findings as:

```markdown

## Review Dimensions

### Correctness
✓ **Check**:
- Does code accomplish stated goal?
- Are edge cases handled? (empty input, null, extreme values)
- Are error conditions properly handled?
- Are there off-by-one errors?
- Are there race conditions or concurrency issues?
- Is state management correct?

❌ **Red Flags**:
- Untested assumptions
- Missing error handling
- Unclear edge case behavior
- Complex logic without comments
- Surprising side effects

### Clarity & Readability
✓ **Check**:
- Can you understand purpose without comments?
- Are names descriptive and accurate?
- Is code self-documenting?
- Is complexity justified?
- Is formatting consistent?

❌ **Red Flags**:
- Cryptic variable names (x, tmp, data)
- Deeply nested logic (>3 levels)
- Functions >50 lines
- Missing comments on complex logic
- Inconsistent style

### Maintainability
✓ **Check**:
- Single Responsibility Principle followed?
- Is code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
- Are dependencies minimal and explicit?
- Is code modular and testable?
- Would changes in requirements break everything?

❌ **Red Flags**:
- Duplicated code
- Tight coupling
- Global state
- Magic numbers
- Hardcoded values
- Swiss army knife functions

### Security
✓ **Check**:
- Are inputs validated and sanitized?
- Is authentication/authorization correct?
- Are secrets hardcoded? (NO!)
- Is sensitive data logged?
- Are dependencies up to date?
- Is SQL injection possible?
- Is XSS possible?

❌ **Red Flags**:
- Raw SQL with string concatenation
- No input validation
- Secrets in code
- Unsafe deserialization
- Missing CSRF protection
- Weak crypto algorithms

### Performance
✓ **Check**:
- Are algorithms appropriate? (O(n) vs O(n²))
- Are there unnecessary loops/queries?
- Is caching appropriate?
- Are large objects copied unnecessarily?
- Are resources released properly?

❌ **Red Flags**:
- N+1 query patterns
- Loading full datasets into memory
- Synchronous I/O in critical path
- Missing database indexes
- Unbounded loops

### Testability
✓ **Check**:
- Can this be unit tested?
- Are dependencies injectable?
- Are side effects isolated?
- Are tests included?
- Is test coverage adequate?

❌ **Red Flags**:
- Hard dependencies on external services
- No tests for complex logic
- Untestable static methods
- Side effects buried in business logic

## Review Feedback Guidelines

### Be Constructive
- Start with positives
- Explain why, not just what
- Suggest solutions, don't just criticize
- Differentiate critical vs. nice-to-have

### Be Specific
- Reference exact locations
- Provide code examples
- Explain the problem clearly
- Show better alternatives

### Be Respectful
- Focus on code, not developer
- Ask questions before assuming
- Acknowledge when you're unsure
- Praise good solutions

### Example Good Feedback

**Good**:
```
File: api/auth.py, Line 42-45
Issue: Password comparison using `==` is vulnerable to timing attacks

Current:
  if user.password == provided_password:

Suggestion:
  if secrets.compare_digest(user.password, provided_password):

Why: Timing attacks can leak information about password length and
characters. Use constant-time comparison for security-sensitive checks.

Severity: CRITICAL (security vulnerability)
```

**Bad**:
```
This is wrong. Fix the password check.
```

## Common Code Smells

### Smells to Flag

- **Long Method**: Function >50 lines, does too much
- **Long Parameter List**: >3-4 parameters, consider object
- **Duplicated Code**: Same logic in multiple places
- **Large Class**: Class with >10 methods, split responsibilities
- **Divergent Change**: One class changed for many reasons
- **Feature Envy**: Method uses another class more than its own
- **Data Clumps**: Same group of data passed around
- **Primitive Obsession**: Using primitives instead of small objects
- **Switch Statements**: Often indicates missing polymorphism
- **Speculative Generality**: "We might need this someday"
- **Dead Code**: Unused code should be deleted
- **Comments**: Explaining bad code instead of fixing it

## Language-Specific Checks

### Python
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints present?
- Exception handling appropriate?
- Context managers for resources?
- List comprehensions vs. loops
- Generator usage for large data

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Const vs let (avoid var)
- Type safety (TypeScript)
- Async/await vs promises
- Error boundaries (React)
- Memory leaks (event listeners)
- Bundle size impact

### General
- File organization
- Import structure
- Naming conventions
- Documentation standards
- Test coverage

## Review Summary

**Overall Assessment**: APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS

The authentication implementation is solid and secure. Good use of
established libraries and clear separation of concerns. A few suggestions
to improve error handling and testability.

**Key Strengths**:
- Uses bcrypt for password hashing (good security practice)
- Proper JWT token generation and validation
- Clear separation between auth logic and API routes

**Critical Issues**: None

**Suggestions**:
1. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
2. Improve error messages (don't leak whether email exists)
3. Add unit tests for token validation edge cases

## Detailed Review

### File: api/auth.py

**Lines 15-25: login() function**
✓ Good: Proper password hashing verification
✓ Good: JWT token generation with expiry

⚠️ Suggestion (Line 20):
Current: `return {"error": "User not found"}`
Better: `return {"error": "Invalid credentials"}`
Why: Don't leak whether email exists (security best practice)

⚠️ Suggestion (Line 25):
Consider adding rate limiting:
```python
@limiter.limit("5 per minute")
def login():
```
Why: Prevents brute force attacks on login endpoint

**Lines 30-40: register() function**
✓ Good: Email validation
✓ Good: Password strength check

💡 Observation: Consider adding email verification flow

### File: tests/test_auth.py

⚠️ Suggestion: Add edge case tests
- Expired token handling
- Invalid token format
- Malformed JWT
- Concurrent login attempts

## Test Coverage

Current: ~75% (good)
Missing: Edge cases for token validation

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Update error messages to not leak user existence
2. [ ] Add rate limiting to login endpoint
3. [ ] Add edge case tests for token validation
4. [ ] Consider email verification flow
