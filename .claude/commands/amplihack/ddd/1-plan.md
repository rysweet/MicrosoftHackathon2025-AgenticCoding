# DDD Phase 1: Planning & Design

Arr! Time to chart the course before we set sail on this feature, matey!

## Yer Task: Create Complete Implementation Plan

**Goal**: Design and plan the feature before touching ANY files

**Output**: `ai_working/ddd/plan.md` - Complete specification for all subsequent phases

---

## Phase 1 Steps, Arr!

### 1. Problem Framing

Answer these questions:
- What are we buildin'?
- Why does it matter?
- What's the user value?
- What problem does this solve?

### 2. Reconnaissance

Explore the codebase:
- Use Glob to find relevant files
- Use Grep to search for related code
- Understand current architecture
- Identify patterns to follow
- Find files that will be affected

**Document**: Current state, related code, architecture context

### 3. Design Proposals

Develop the approach:
- Propose initial design
- Consider alternatives (at least 2)
- Analyze trade-offs
- Check against philosophy:
  - Ruthless Simplicity? ‚úì
  - Modular Design? ‚úì
  - Clear interfaces? ‚úì
  - Zero-BS implementation? ‚úì
- Iterate with user on decisions

**Get user feedback on design direction before proceedin'**

### 4. Create Detailed Plan

Write `ai_working/ddd/plan.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# DDD Plan: [Feature Name]

## Problem Statement

[What we're solving and why - clear user value]

## Proposed Solution

[How we'll solve it - high level approach]

## Alternatives Considered

[Other approaches we evaluated and why we chose this one]

## Architecture & Design

### Key Interfaces

[Define the "studs" - how modules connect]

### Module Boundaries

[What goes where, clear separation of concerns]

### Data Models

[Key data structures, if applicable]

## Files to Change

### Non-Code Files (Phase 2)

- [ ] docs/file1.md - [what needs updating]
- [ ] README.md - [what needs updating]
- [ ] config/example.toml - [what needs updating]
      [... complete list of ALL non-code files]

### Code Files (Phase 4)

- [ ] src/module1.py - [what needs changing]
- [ ] src/module2.py - [what needs changing]
      [... complete list of ALL code files]

## Philosophy Alignment

### Ruthless Simplicity

- Start minimal: [how]
- Avoid future-proofing: [what we're NOT building]
- Clear over clever: [examples]

### Modular Design

- Bricks (modules): [list self-contained pieces]
- Studs (interfaces): [list connection points]
- Regeneratable: [could rebuild from this spec]

### Zero-BS Implementation

- No stubs or placeholders
- No TODOs in code
- Everything works or doesn't exist

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests

[What unit tests we'll need]

### Integration Tests

[What integration tests we'll need]

### User Testing

[How we'll actually test as a user]

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 2 (Docs)

[Specific docs to update, what to document]

### Phase 4 (Code)

[Chunks to implement, order matters if dependencies]

## Success Criteria

[How do we know it's done and working?]

## Next Steps

‚úÖ Plan complete and approved
‚û°Ô∏è Ready for `/amplihack:ddd:2-docs`
```

---

## Using TodoWrite

Track planning tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] Problem framing complete
- [ ] Reconnaissance done
- [ ] Design proposals drafted
- [ ] User feedback incorporated
- [ ] Detailed plan written
- [ ] Philosophy alignment checked
- [ ] Plan reviewed with user
```

---

## Agent Suggestions, Matey!

Consider spawning agents for help:

**architect** - For complex architectural decisions:
```
Task architect: "Design approach for [feature], considering
philosophy and modular design principles"
```

**Explore agent** - For codebase reconnaissance:
```
Task Explore: "Find all code related to [topic], understand
current patterns and architecture"
```

---

## Important Notes

**DO NOT write any files yet** - This phase is PLANNING ONLY

**Iterate until solid**:
- Get user feedback on design direction
- Refine proposals based on feedback
- Clarify ambiguities
- Ensure shared understanding

**Philosophy check**:
- Does this follow ruthless simplicity?
- Are module boundaries clear?
- Can we build in increments?
- Is this the simplest approach that works?
- No stubs, no placeholders?

---

## When Planning is Approved

### Checklist

- [ ] Problem clearly framed
- [ ] Reconnaissance complete
- [ ] Design approach agreed upon
- [ ] All files to change identified
- [ ] Philosophy principles followed
- [ ] Test strategy defined
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved plan

### Exit Message

```
‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: Planning Approved

Plan written to: ai_working/ddd/plan.md

Next Phase: Update all non-code files (docs, configs, READMEs)

Run: /amplihack:ddd:2-docs

The plan will guide all subsequent phases. All commands can now
run without arguments using the plan as their guide.
```

---

## Process

- Use TodoWrite tool to track all tasks and subtasks
- Spawn agents in parallel when possible
- For each agent: delegate clearly, capture output, summarize insights
- Perform reflection phase to combine insights
- Iterate until confident

---

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't know where to start"**
- Start with problem framing
- Then do reconnaissance to understand current state
- Design emerges from understanding problem + current state

**"Too many files affected"**
- That's okay - we'll process them systematically in phase 2
- File crawling technique handles large batches

**"Unclear about design direction"**
- Propose 2-3 alternatives
- Present to user with trade-offs
- Iterate until clear

**"Philosophy conflict"**
- If design violates simplicity/modularity, reconsider
- Simpler is usually better
- Ask user if complexity is justified
