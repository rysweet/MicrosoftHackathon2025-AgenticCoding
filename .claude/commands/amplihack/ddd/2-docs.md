# DDD Phase 2: Non-Code Changes

Arr! Time to update all the documentation like the feature already exists, matey!

## Yer Task: Update All Non-Code Files

**Goal**: Update docs, configs, READMEs to reflect new feature AS IF IT ALREADY EXISTS

**This phase iterates until user approves - stay in this phase as long as needed**

---

## Phase 2 Steps, Arr!

### 1. Generate File Index

Create `ai_working/ddd/docs_index.txt`:

```bash
# Read the plan to get list of non-code files
# Create checklist in format:
[ ] docs/file1.md
[ ] README.md
[ ] config/example.toml
...
```

This index be yer working checklist - mark files complete as ye process them.

### 2. File Crawling - Process One File at a Time

**THIS BE CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS**:

For each file in the index:

1. **Load full context**:
   - Read the file
   - Read relevant parts of plan
   - Load related docs if needed

2. **Update with retcon writing**:
   - Write as if feature ALREADY EXISTS
   - No "will be", "going to", "planned"
   - Present tense: "The system does X"
   - No historical references
   - No migration notes in docs

3. **Apply Maximum DRY**:
   - Each concept in ONE place only
   - No duplicate documentation
   - Use references/links instead of duplication
   - If found elsewhere, consolidate to best location

4. **Check for context poisoning**:
   - Conflicts with other docs?
   - Inconsistent terminology?
   - Contradictory statements?
   - If found: PAUSE, document conflicts, ask user

5. **Mark complete in index**:
   ```bash
   # Change [ ] to [x]
   [x] docs/file1.md
   ```

6. **Move to next file** - REPEAT until all files processed

**Why file crawling?**:
- Token efficiency (99.5% reduction for large batches)
- Prevents missing files
- Clear progress tracking
- Resumable if interrupted
- Avoids context overflow

### 3. Progressive Organization

As ye update docs:

**Keep it right-sized**:
- Not over-compressed (missing critical info)
- Not overly detailed (lost in noise)
- Balance clarity vs completeness

**Follow structure**:
- README ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí Details
- High-level concepts first
- Specific details later
- Examples that actually work

**Audience-appropriate**:
- User docs: How to use it
- Developer docs: How it works
- Architecture docs: Why designed this way

### 4. Verification Pass

After all files updated:

1. **Read through all changed docs** (use file index)
2. **Check consistency**:
   - Terminology consistent?
   - Examples would work?
   - No contradictions?
3. **Verify DRY**:
   - Each concept in one place?
   - No duplicate explanations?
4. **Check philosophy alignment**:
   - Ruthless simplicity maintained?
   - Clear module boundaries?
   - Zero-BS (no TODOs, no placeholders)?

### 5. Generate Review Materials

Create `ai_working/ddd/docs_status.md`:

```markdown
# Phase 2: Non-Code Changes Complete

## Summary

[High-level description of what was changed]

## Files Changed

[List from git status]

## Key Changes

### docs/file1.md
- [What changed and why]

### README.md
- [What changed and why]

[... for each file]

## Deviations from Plan

[Any changes from original plan and why]

## Approval Checklist

Please review the changes:

- [ ] All affected docs updated?
- [ ] Retcon writing applied (no "will be")?
- [ ] Maximum DRY enforced (no duplication)?
- [ ] Context poisoning eliminated?
- [ ] Progressive organization maintained?
- [ ] Philosophy principles followed?
- [ ] Examples work (could copy-paste and use)?
- [ ] No implementation details leaked into user docs?

## Git Diff Summary

[Insert: git diff --stat]

## Review Instructions

1. Review the git diff (shown below)
2. Check above checklist
3. Provide feedback for any changes needed
4. When satisfied, commit with yer own message

## Next Steps After Commit

When ye've committed the docs, run: `/amplihack:ddd:3-code-plan`
```

### 6. Show Git Diff

Run these commands to show user the changes:

```bash
cd ai_working/ddd/
git add [changed files]
git status
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

**IMPORTANT**: Stage the changes with `git add` but **DO NOT COMMIT**

---

## Iteration Loop

**This phase stays active until user approves**:

If user provides feedback:

1. Note the feedback
2. Make requested changes
3. Update docs_status.md
4. Show new diff
5. Repeat until user says "approved"

**Common feedback examples**:
- "This section needs more detail"
- "Example doesn't match our style"
- "Add documentation for X feature"
- "This contradicts docs/other.md"

**For each feedback**: Address it, then regenerate review materials

---

## Using TodoWrite

Track doc update tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] Generate file index
- [ ] Process file 1 of N
- [ ] Process file 2 of N
      ...
- [ ] Verification pass complete
- [ ] Review materials generated
- [ ] User review in progress
```

---

## Agent Suggestions

**concept-extractor** - For extracting knowledge from complex docs:
```
Task concept-extractor: "Extract key concepts from [source] to include
in [target doc]"
```

---

## Retcon Writing Examples

**‚ùå BAD (Traditional)**:
```markdown
## Authentication (Coming in v2.0)

We will add JWT authentication support. Users will be able to
authenticate with tokens. This feature is planned for next quarter.

Migration: Update your config to add `auth: jwt` section.
```

**‚úÖ GOOD (Retcon)**:
```markdown
## Authentication

The system uses JWT authentication. Users authenticate with tokens
that expire after 24 hours.

Configure authentication in your config file:

```yaml
auth:
  type: jwt
  expiry: 24h
```

See [Authentication Guide](auth.md) for details.
```

---

## Context Poisoning Detection

**PAUSE if ye find**:
- Same concept explained differently in multiple places
- Contradictory statements about behavior
- Inconsistent terminology for same thing
- Feature described differently in different docs

**Actions when found**:
1. Document the conflicts
2. Note which docs conflict
3. Ask user: "Which version is correct?"
4. After clarification, fix ALL instances

---

## Important Notes

**Maximum DRY is critical**:
- If ye copy-paste content between docs: WRONG
- If same concept appears twice: CONSOLIDATE
- Use links/references instead of duplication

**Retcon everywhere**:
- User docs: "The system does X"
- Developer docs: "The module implements Y"
- Config examples: Show the actual config (it works)
- No "TODO", "Coming soon", "Will be added"

**Stage but don't commit**:
- Use `git add` to stage
- Show diff to user
- Let USER commit when satisfied
- USER writes commit message

---

## When User Approves

### Exit Message

```
‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete: Non-Code Changes Approved

All documentation updated and staged.

‚ö†Ô∏è USER ACTION REQUIRED:
Review the changes above and commit when satisfied:

    git commit -m "docs: [yer description]"

After committing, proceed to code planning:

    /amplihack:ddd:3-code-plan

The updated docs are now the specification that code must match, arr!
```

---

## Process

- Use TodoWrite tool to track all tasks
- For each file: load context, update, verify, mark complete
- Perform verification pass
- Generate review materials
- Iterate based on feedback

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Too many files to track"**
- That's what file crawling solves
- Use the index file as checklist
- Process one at a time

**"Found conflicts between docs"**
- Document them clearly
- Ask user which is correct
- Fix all instances after clarification

**"Unsure how much detail to include"**
- Follow progressive organization
- Start with high-level in main docs
- Link to detailed docs for specifics
- Ask user if uncertain

**"User feedback requires major rework"**
- That's fine! Better now than after code is written
- This is why we have approval gate before coding
- Iterate as many times as needed
