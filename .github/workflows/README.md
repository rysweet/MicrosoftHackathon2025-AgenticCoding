# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This GitHub Actions CI pipeline ensures code quality by running formatting, linting, and test checks on every pull request.

## Workflow: ci.yml

### Triggers

- **Pull Requests**: Runs on open, synchronize (new commits), and reopen
- **Main Branch**: Runs on pushes to main for post-merge validation

### Jobs

#### 1. Validate Code

Runs all code quality checks:

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Formatting, linting for all languages
- **Python tests**: pytest suite
- **JavaScript/TypeScript tests**: npm test (if applicable)

### Features

- **Fast execution**: Aggressive caching, parallel setup
- **Smart concurrency**: Cancels outdated runs automatically
- **Clear feedback**: Detailed status reporting
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues even if some tools missing

## Local Testing

Before pushing, run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run Python tests
pytest

# Run JavaScript tests (if applicable)
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running?

- Check if Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Verify file is in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Ensure file has `.yml` or `.yaml` extension

### Checks failing?

1. Check the workflow logs for specific errors
2. Run checks locally to reproduce
3. Fix issues and push again

### Too slow?

- Check cache hit rates in logs
- Consider running fewer hooks
- Use `fetch-depth: 1` if full history not needed

## Maintenance

### Adding new checks

1. Add tool to pre-commit config first
2. Test locally
3. Push and verify in CI

### Adjusting strictness

- Initially set to `continue-on-error: true` for gradual adoption
- Remove `continue-on-error` once codebase is clean
- Add more checks as team comfort grows
