# Amplihack Install Command - Comprehensive Fix Summary

## Problem

The `_local_install()` function in `src/amplihack/__init__.py` only copied
limited directories (agents, commands, tools) and didn't handle the full
installation properly, causing issues when running from uvx or outside the repo
directory.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Directory Copying

Updated `copytree_manifest()` to copy ALL essential directories:

- `agents/amplihack` - Specialized agents
- `commands/amplihack` - Slash commands
- `tools/amplihack` - Hooks and utilities
- `context/` - Philosophy, patterns, project info
- `workflow/` - DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md

### 2. Settings.json Management

Created `ensure_settings_json()` function that:

- Creates settings.json if it doesn't exist
- Backs up existing settings before modification
- Updates all hook paths to use absolute paths (`$HOME/.claude/...`)
- Ensures proper permissions and additionalDirectories configuration
- Handles all hook types: SessionStart, Stop, PostToolUse, PreCompact

### 3. Runtime Directory Creation

Added `create_runtime_dirs()` to create necessary directories:

- `.claude/runtime/`
- `.claude/runtime/logs/`
- `.claude/runtime/metrics/`
- `.claude/runtime/security/`
- `.claude/runtime/analysis/`

### 4. Hook Verification

Added `verify_hooks()` to ensure all hook files exist:

- `session_start.py`
- `stop.py`
- `post_tool_use.py`
- `pre_compact.py`

### 5. Improved Uninstall

Enhanced `uninstall()` function to:

- Remove all files from manifest
- Explicitly remove amplihack directories (handles manifest issues)
- Provide detailed feedback on what was removed
- Clean up properly even if manifest is incomplete

### 6. Comprehensive Error Handling

- Progress messages with emojis for clarity
- Proper error reporting at each step
- Graceful handling of missing directories
- Backup creation before modifications

## Key Files Modified

### `/src/amplihack/__init__.py`

- Added constants: `ESSENTIAL_DIRS`, `RUNTIME_DIRS`, `SETTINGS_TEMPLATE`
- Enhanced `copytree_manifest()` to handle all directories
- Added `ensure_settings_json()` for settings management
- Added `verify_hooks()` for validation
- Added `create_runtime_dirs()` for runtime setup
- Completely rewrote `_local_install()` with comprehensive workflow
- Improved `uninstall()` with explicit directory removal

## Testing

### Test Files Created

1. `test_install.py` - Basic installation test
2. `test_comprehensive_install.py` - Full test suite:
   - Fresh installation test
   - Upgrade installation test
   - Uninstall/reinstall cycle test
   - External directory installation test
3. `test_uvx_scenario.py` - Simulates UVX deployment scenario

### Test Results

All tests pass successfully:

- ✅ Fresh installation works correctly
- ✅ Upgrade preserves settings and creates backups
- ✅ Uninstall properly removes all amplihack components
- ✅ External directory installation (uvx simulation) works
- ✅ All hooks use absolute paths after installation
- ✅ All runtime directories are created

## Backward Compatibility

- Maintains manifest system for tracking installed files
- Works with existing CLI commands
- Compatible with both local development and uvx deployment
- Preserves existing settings during upgrades

## Usage

### Install

```python
from amplihack import _local_install
_local_install('/path/to/repo')
```

### Uninstall

```python
from amplihack import uninstall
uninstall()
```

### From CLI

```bash
# Install
amplihack install

# Uninstall
amplihack uninstall

# Local install (hidden command)
amplihack _local_install /path/to/repo
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Installation**: All necessary files and directories are copied
2. **Proper Hook Configuration**: Absolute paths ensure hooks work from any
   location
3. **Runtime Support**: Creates directories needed for logging and metrics
4. **Clean Uninstall**: Properly removes all amplihack components
5. **User Feedback**: Clear progress messages and error reporting
6. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases and partial installations gracefully

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and tested. The code is ready to be merged back
to the main branch.
