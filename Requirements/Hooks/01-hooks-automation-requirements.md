- MUST run make check after code changes
- MUST execute test suites on modifications
- MUST validate code before commits
- MUST format code automatically

#### FR-HA-003: Session Management Hooks
- MUST run initialization on session start
- MUST perform cleanup on session end
- MUST save context on stop events
- MUST restore state on resume
- MUST log session activities

#### FR-HA-004: Notification System
- MUST send desktop notifications
