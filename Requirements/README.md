## Foundational Philosophy and Principles

The system is built on core philosophical foundations that guide all design and implementation decisions:

### Philosophy and Design Principles

- **[Implementation Philosophy](Philosophy/01-implementation-philosophy-requirements.md)** - Ruthless simplicity, emergence, zero-BS principle
- **[Modular Design Philosophy](Philosophy/02-modular-design-philosophy-requirements.md)** - Bricks and studs pattern, regeneration over editing

These philosophical requirements ensure the system:
- Enforces ruthless simplicity and rejects unnecessary complexity
- Implements the "bricks and studs" modular architecture
- Prefers module regeneration over line-by-line editing
- Follows analysis-first development patterns
- Maintains single source of truth for configuration
- Embodies trust in emergence over central control

## System Value Proposition

Amplifier transforms AI coding assistants into force multipliers by providing:

1. **Specialized Expertise** - 21 agents each excelling at specific tasks
2. **Knowledge Accumulation** - Every interaction builds persistent knowledge
3. **Parallel Exploration** - Test multiple solutions simultaneously
4. **Automated Quality** - Hooks ensure consistent code quality
5. **Contextual Memory** - Learn from past interactions and decisions

## Key Design Principles

### Ruthless Simplicity & Zero-BS
- Every component must justify its complexity
- No placeholder code or stubs - everything works or doesn't exist
- Start minimal, grow as needed
- Avoid premature optimization and future-proofing
- Trust in emergence over central control

### Modular Architecture ("Bricks and Studs")
- Self-contained modules as regeneratable bricks
- Clear contracts as stable connection points (studs)
- Regeneration over line-by-line editing
- Blueprint-driven development with AI builders
- Human architects, AI implementers

### Analysis-First Development
- Analyze problems before implementing
- Document multiple approaches with trade-offs
- Create structured implementation plans
- Validate approach before coding
- Track decision rationale

### Parallel Development
- Multiple solutions built and tested simultaneously
- Isolated worktrees with data synchronization
- Rapid experimentation through regeneration
- Learn from variant performance
- Merge successful patterns

### Knowledge-Driven
- Extract knowledge from all content
- Synthesize patterns across sources
- Preserve productive tensions and contradictions
- Query accumulated wisdom
- Document discoveries for reuse

## Performance Requirements

### Processing Speed
- Document extraction: 10-30 seconds per document
- Knowledge synthesis: < 5 minutes for 100+ documents
- Graph operations: < 2 seconds for queries
- Command response: < 1 second to start

### Scalability
- Handle 1000+ documents in knowledge base
- Support 100,000+ concepts in graph
- Process 10,000 word chunks
- Manage 50+ parallel worktrees

## Reliability Requirements

### Fault Tolerance
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Incremental processing with saves
- Retry mechanisms for I/O operations
- Cloud sync handling

### Data Integrity
- Atomic write operations
- Version management
- Backup and restore
- Consistency validation

## Using These Requirements

These requirements serve multiple purposes:

1. **Implementation Guide** - Define what must be built
2. **Test Planning** - Generate test cases from requirements
3. **Documentation** - Create user guides from functional specs
4. **Validation** - Verify implementations meet requirements
5. **Evolution** - Track changes and additions over time

Each requirement document follows a consistent structure:
- Purpose statement
- Functional requirements (FR-*)
- Input requirements (IR-*)
- Output requirements (OR-*)
- Performance requirements (PR-*)
- Quality/reliability requirements (QR-*/RR-*)

## Next Steps

To implement a new version of Amplifier:

1. Start with core components (Knowledge, Agents)
2. Build command-line interface for user interaction
3. Add development workflow tools
4. Implement hooks and automation
5. Integrate memory system
6. Test with parallel worktrees

Each component can be developed independently following its requirements, then integrated using the defined interfaces.
