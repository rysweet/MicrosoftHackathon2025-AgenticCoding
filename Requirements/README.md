# Amplifier System Requirements Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive requirements documentation for the Amplifier system, organized by functional area.

## Main Requirements Document

- **[Requirements.md](../../amplifier/Requirements.md)** - Core functional and non-functional requirements for the Amplifier system

## Specialized Requirements

### Infrastructure & Operations

- **[configuration-requirements.md](configuration-requirements.md)** - Centralized configuration and path management
- **[file-io-requirements.md](file-io-requirements.md)** - File operations with cloud sync handling
- **[event-system-requirements.md](event-system-requirements.md)** - Event logging, streaming, and replay
- **[utility-requirements.md](utility-requirements.md)** - Logging, token management, fingerprinting, and stream processing

### Development & Testing

- **[testing-validation-requirements.md](testing-validation-requirements.md)** - AI-driven testing and validation
- **[development-tools-requirements.md](development-tools-requirements.md)** - AI context building and environment tools
- **[cli-tools-requirements.md](cli-tools-requirements.md)** - Command-line interfaces and hook scripts

### Knowledge Management

- **[knowledge-graph-operations-requirements.md](knowledge-graph-operations-requirements.md)** - Graph visualization, path finding, and analysis
- **[synthesis-pipeline-requirements.md](synthesis-pipeline-requirements.md)** - Document triage and query-based synthesis

## Requirement Format

All requirements follow a consistent format:

- **Technology-agnostic** - Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- **Complete sentences** - Clear, testable statements using SHALL
- **Unique identifiers** - Each requirement has a traceable ID
- **Organized by category** - Grouped by functional area

## Requirement ID Convention

Requirements use the following ID format: `[CATEGORY]-[SUBCATEGORY]-[NUMBER]`

Examples:
- `CFG-PATH-001` - Configuration Path requirement #1
- `FIO-CLOUD-003` - File I/O Cloud sync requirement #3
- `TST-AI-002` - Testing AI-driven requirement #2

## Purpose

These requirements serve as:
1. **Contract for implementation** - Define what must be built
2. **Test criteria** - Verify system meets specifications
3. **Knowledge transfer** - Document system capabilities
4. **Design guidance** - Inform architectural decisions

## Coverage

The requirements cover all major system components including:
- Core knowledge management functionality
- Development workflow automation
- AI agent ecosystem
- Testing and validation frameworks
- File and configuration management
- Event systems and logging
- Command-line interfaces
- Graph operations and visualization
- Document synthesis pipelines
- Utility functions and helpers

## Maintenance

Requirements should be updated when:
- New functionality is added to the system
- Existing functionality changes significantly
- Gaps are discovered in current coverage
- Clarification is needed for ambiguous areas

Each requirement should be:
- **Atomic** - One requirement per statement
- **Testable** - Can verify if met
- **Necessary** - Required for system operation
- **Consistent** - No conflicts with other requirements
- **Clear** - Unambiguous meaning
