# Code Quality Requirements

## Purpose
Ensure code quality through automated formatting, linting, type checking, and testing with integrated quality gates and reporting.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Quality Operations

#### FR-CQ-001: Code Formatting
- MUST format Python code with ruff
- MUST apply consistent style rules
- MUST fix formatting automatically
- MUST preserve code semantics
- MUST handle all Python files in project

#### FR-CQ-002: Code Linting
- MUST detect code style violations
- MUST identify potential bugs
- MUST check for code smells
- MUST apply auto-fixes where safe
- MUST provide clear error messages

#### FR-CQ-003: Type Checking
- MUST perform static type analysis with pyright
- MUST validate type hints
- MUST detect type mismatches
- MUST check function signatures
- MUST report type coverage metrics

#### FR-CQ-004: Stub Detection
- MUST identify placeholder code (NotImplementedError)
- MUST find TODO comments without implementation
- MUST detect mock/fake functions
- MUST report incomplete implementations
- MUST distinguish legitimate patterns from stubs

#### FR-CQ-005: Test Execution
- MUST run unit tests with pytest
- MUST execute integration tests
- MUST support smoke tests
- MUST generate coverage reports
- MUST enable parallel test execution

## Input Requirements

### IR-CQ-001: Configuration
- Ruff configuration (line length, rules)
- Pyright settings (strict mode, excludes)
- Test discovery patterns
- Coverage thresholds
- Quality gate criteria

### IR-CQ-002: Source Code
- Python source files
- Test files
- Configuration files
- Documentation files

## Output Requirements

### OR-CQ-001: Quality Reports
- Formatting changes applied
- Linting violations found
- Type checking errors
- Stub detection results
- Test execution summary

### OR-CQ-002: Metrics
- Code coverage percentage
- Type coverage metrics
- Linting score
- Test pass/fail counts
- Quality trend data

## Performance Requirements

### PR-CQ-001: Execution Speed
- MUST complete formatting in < 5 seconds
- MUST lint entire codebase in < 10 seconds
- MUST type check in < 30 seconds
- MUST run smoke tests in < 2 minutes

### PR-CQ-002: Incremental Checking
- MUST support incremental linting
- MUST cache type checking results
- MUST run only affected tests
- MUST optimize for rapid feedback

## Automation Requirements

### AR-CQ-001: Continuous Checking
- MUST run on file save (VS Code integration)
- MUST execute on git commits
- MUST trigger on pull requests
- MUST integrate with CI/CD pipelines

### AR-CQ-002: Auto-Fix Capabilities
- MUST auto-format on save
- MUST apply safe lint fixes
- MUST suggest type annotations
- MUST generate missing tests

## Quality Standards

### QS-CQ-001: Code Standards
- MUST enforce line length (120 chars)
- MUST require type hints for functions
- MUST maintain import organization
- MUST ensure consistent naming

### QS-CQ-002: Test Standards
- MUST achieve 60% unit test coverage
- MUST have 30% integration tests
- MUST include 10% end-to-end tests
- MUST test critical paths 100%
