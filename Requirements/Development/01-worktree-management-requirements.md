# Worktree Management Requirements

## Purpose
Enable parallel development through isolated version control workspaces with data synchronization, supporting simultaneous exploration of multiple solutions.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Worktree Operations

#### FR-WT-001: Worktree Creation
- MUST create version control workspaces with unique branch names
- MUST copy data directories to new workspace
- MUST preserve virtual environment settings
- MUST set up isolated workspace
- MUST track workspace in version control

#### FR-WT-002: Data Synchronization
- MUST copy knowledge base to worktree
- MUST maintain separate data directories
- MUST support selective data copying
- MUST preserve data integrity during copy
- MUST handle large data directories (> 1GB)

#### FR-WT-003: Worktree Management
- MUST list all active worktrees
- MUST show worktree status and branches
- MUST support worktree removal
- MUST clean up associated branches
- MUST handle forced removal with changes

#### FR-WT-004: Branch Management
- MUST create feature branches automatically
- MUST track upstream branches
- MUST support branch deletion on removal
- MUST prevent accidental main branch operations
- MUST handle branch conflicts

#### FR-WT-005: Environment Isolation
- MUST maintain separate development environments
- MUST isolate dependencies per workspace
- MUST preserve environment variables
- MUST support environment synchronization
- MUST handle virtual environment activation

## Input Requirements

### IR-WT-001: Creation Parameters
- The system must accept workspace and branch names as input
- The system must accept a base branch specification, defaulting to current branch
- The system must accept preferences for which data to copy to the new workspace
- Environment settings

### IR-WT-002: Management Commands
- Worktree name for operations
- Force flags for removal
- List filtering options

## Output Requirements

### OR-WT-001: Worktree Information
- Worktree path location
- Associated branch name
- Creation timestamp
- Data directory size
- Environment status

### OR-WT-002: Operation Results
- Success/failure status
- Created paths
- Copied data statistics
- Cleanup confirmation

## Performance Requirements

### PR-WT-001: Creation Speed
- MUST create worktree in < 10 seconds
- MUST copy data efficiently (> 100MB/s)
- MUST parallelize file operations
- MUST show progress for long operations

### PR-WT-002: Management Operations
- MUST list worktrees instantly
- MUST remove worktrees in < 5 seconds
- MUST handle 50+ simultaneous worktrees

## Safety Requirements

### SR-WT-001: Data Protection
- MUST confirm before removing worktrees with changes
- MUST backup data before removal
- MUST prevent accidental data loss
- MUST validate operations before execution

### SR-WT-002: Version Control Safety
- MUST check for uncommitted changes
- MUST prevent branch conflicts
- MUST maintain git repository integrity
- MUST handle failed operations gracefully
