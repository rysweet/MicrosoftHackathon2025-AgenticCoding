# Concept Extractor Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Identifies and extracts core concepts from content, building taxonomies and concept hierarchies.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR11.1: MUST identify primary and secondary concepts
- FR11.2: MUST determine concept relationships and hierarchies
- FR11.3: MUST extract concept definitions and contexts
- FR11.4: MUST build concept taxonomies
- FR11.5: MUST track concept evolution across sources
- FR11.6: MUST identify concept boundaries and overlaps

## Input Requirements
- IR11.1: Source content for extraction
- IR11.2: Domain vocabulary (if available)
- IR11.3: Extraction granularity level
- IR11.4: Concept relationship rules

## Output Requirements
- OR11.1: Concept inventory with definitions
- OR11.2: Concept hierarchy/taxonomy
- OR11.3: Relationship graph
- OR11.4: Context snippets for each concept
- OR11.5: Concept evolution timeline

## Quality Requirements
- QR11.1: Concepts must be clearly defined
- QR11.2: Hierarchies must be logically consistent
- QR11.3: Relationships must be bidirectional
- QR11.4: Extraction must be reproducible
