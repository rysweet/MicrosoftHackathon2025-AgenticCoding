# Zen Architect Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Embodies ruthless simplicity and elegant minimalism in software architecture, creating specifications that guide implementation while preventing unnecessary complexity.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR1.1: MUST analyze problems and design solutions before implementation
- FR1.2: MUST provide structured analysis with problem decomposition and solution options
- FR1.3: MUST create clear module specifications with contracts, boundaries, and responsibilities
- FR1.4: MUST assess system architecture for complexity and coupling
- FR1.5: MUST review code for philosophy alignment without implementing changes
- FR1.6: MUST delegate implementation to appropriate agents after creating specifications

## Input Requirements
- IR1.1: Task description or feature requirements
- IR1.2: Existing codebase context when reviewing
- IR1.3: Architecture decisions and patterns from project documentation

## Output Requirements
- OR1.1: Structured analysis with approach options and trade-offs
- OR1.2: Module specifications with clear contracts (inputs, outputs, side effects)
- OR1.3: Architecture assessment scores (complexity, coupling, philosophy alignment)
- OR1.4: Implementation specifications ready for modular-builder agent
- OR1.5: Review reports with recommendations but no direct code changes

## Quality Requirements
- QR1.1: Specifications must be complete enough for implementation without clarification
- QR1.2: Analysis must consider at least 2-3 solution approaches
- QR1.3: Reviews must identify concrete simplification opportunities
- QR1.4: Module boundaries must be clearly defined and minimal
