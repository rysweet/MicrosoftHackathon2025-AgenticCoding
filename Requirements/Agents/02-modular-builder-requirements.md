# Modular Builder Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Implements modules following the "bricks and studs" pattern, creating self-contained, regeneratable components with clear interfaces.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR2.1: MUST create self-contained module directories with all required files
- FR2.2: MUST implement modules based on provided specifications
- FR2.3: MUST define clear public interfaces via __all__ exports
- FR2.4: MUST include module-level tests within the module directory
- FR2.5: MUST create README documentation for module contracts
- FR2.6: MUST ensure modules can be regenerated without affecting others

## Input Requirements
- IR2.1: Module specification with defined contract
- IR2.2: Dependencies and integration requirements
- IR2.3: Test scenarios and validation criteria

## Output Requirements
- OR2.1: Complete module directory structure
- OR2.2: Implementation files following specification
- OR2.3: Module-level tests
- OR2.4: README with contract documentation
- OR2.5: Public interface definitions

## Quality Requirements
- QR2.1: Modules must be completely self-contained
- QR2.2: All public interfaces must be explicitly exported
- QR2.3: Tests must validate the complete contract
- QR2.4: Module must be regeneratable from specification alone
