# Ambiguity Guardian Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Preserves productive contradictions and navigates uncertainty, preventing premature convergence.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR15.1: MUST identify areas of uncertainty
- FR15.2: MUST preserve productive contradictions
- FR15.3: MUST prevent premature convergence
- FR15.4: MUST track ambiguity evolution
- FR15.5: MUST distinguish productive from unproductive ambiguity
- FR15.6: MUST suggest exploration strategies

## Input Requirements
- IR15.1: Conflicting perspectives or data
- IR15.2: Uncertainty indicators
- IR15.3: Convergence pressure points
- IR15.4: Domain stability requirements

## Output Requirements
- OR15.1: Ambiguity inventory with classifications
- OR15.2: Productive contradiction map
- OR15.3: Premature convergence warnings
- OR15.4: Exploration recommendations
- OR15.5: Uncertainty navigation strategies

## Quality Requirements
- QR15.1: Must not force false consensus
- QR15.2: Productive ambiguity must be preserved
- QR15.3: Navigation strategies must be actionable
- QR15.4: Classifications must be justified
