# Knowledge Synthesis Requirements

## Purpose
Synthesize patterns, connections, and insights across extracted knowledge from multiple sources, identifying contradictions and generating higher-level understanding.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Synthesis Capabilities

#### FR-KS-001: Pattern Recognition
- MUST identify recurring patterns across knowledge sources
- MUST detect concept clusters and themes
- MUST find hidden connections between disparate ideas
- MUST recognize meta-patterns (patterns of patterns)
- MUST identify concept evolution across sources

#### FR-KS-002: Contradiction and Tension Management
- MUST detect contradictions between sources
- MUST preserve productive tensions without forcing resolution
- MUST track conflicting viewpoints with attribution
- MUST identify areas of consensus and disagreement
- MUST maintain multiple valid interpretations

#### FR-KS-003: Insight Generation
- MUST generate cross-source insights
- MUST identify emergent themes not present in individual sources
- MUST create synthesis summaries
- MUST generate hypotheses from combined knowledge
- MUST identify knowledge gaps and unknowns

#### FR-KS-004: Knowledge Unification
- MUST merge related concepts from different sources
- MUST resolve entity references across sources
- MUST create unified concept definitions
- MUST build composite relationship networks
- MUST maintain source attribution in unified knowledge

#### FR-KS-005: Confidence and Quality Assessment
- MUST assign confidence scores to synthesized knowledge
- MUST track agreement levels across sources
- MUST identify well-supported vs. speculative insights
- MUST provide synthesis quality metrics
- MUST flag areas needing human review
