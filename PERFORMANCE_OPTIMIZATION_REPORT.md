## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Performance Gains vs Complexity

| Optimization          | Performance Gain | Complexity Increase | Maintenance Impact          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Connection Pooling    | HIGH (60-80%)    | LOW                 | Low - Standard pattern      |
| Response Caching      | HIGH (40-60%)    | MEDIUM              | Medium - Cache invalidation |
| Batch I/O             | HIGH (70-90%)    | MEDIUM              | Medium - Async coordination |
| Pre-compiled Patterns | MEDIUM (40-60%)  | LOW                 | Low - One-time setup        |
| Adaptive Intervals    | MEDIUM (20-40%)  | HIGH                | High - Complex logic        |

### Memory vs Speed Trade-offs

1. **Response Caching** - Monitor cache hit rates and invalidation
2. **Memory-based Session Cache** - Monitor memory usage trends
3. **Parallel Initialization** - Test startup behavior thoroughly

#### Deploy with Caution (Medium Value, Higher Risk)

1. **Adaptive Analysis Intervals** - Complex logic, test extensively
