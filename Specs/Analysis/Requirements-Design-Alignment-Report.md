# Requirements-Design Alignment Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the alignment between requirements and design documents for the AgenticCoding system. The analysis identifies critical gaps, conflicts, and areas where requirements are not addressed by existing designs.

**Key Finding**: While the system has comprehensive requirements and module designs, there are significant gaps in coverage, particularly around event systems, file I/O handling, and specialized agent implementations.

## Critical Unaddressed Requirements

### 1. Event System Requirements (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Gap**: No dedicated Event Module design exists despite extensive event requirements

**Unaddressed Requirements**:
- **EVT-LOG-001 through EVT-LOG-007**: Event logging operations not designed
- **EVT-FILT-001 through EVT-FILT-006**: Event filtering capabilities missing
- **EVT-STRM-001 through EVT-STRM-005**: Real-time event streaming not designed
- **EVT-RPLY-001 through EVT-RPLY-005**: Event replay functionality absent
- **EVT-PIPE-001 through EVT-PIPE-005**: Pipeline event tracking not specified
- **EVT-STOR-001 through EVT-STOR-006**: Event storage architecture missing
- **EVT-ANAL-001 through EVT-ANAL-005**: Event analysis capabilities not designed

**Impact**: The system cannot track operations, provide audit trails, or enable debugging without a proper event system.

**Recommended Solution**: Create a dedicated EventModule.md design document that addresses all event requirements with proper storage, streaming, and analysis capabilities.

### 2. File I/O and Cloud Sync Requirements (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Gap**: No dedicated File I/O module design for robust file operations

**Unaddressed Requirements**:
- **FIO-BASIC-001 through FIO-BASIC-005**: Basic file operations not standardized
- **FIO-CLOUD-001 through FIO-CLOUD-007**: Cloud sync handling missing
- **FIO-ERROR-001 through FIO-ERROR-006**: Error recovery strategies not designed
- **FIO-CROSS-001 through FIO-CROSS-005**: Cross-platform handling absent
- **FIO-PERF-001 through FIO-PERF-005**: Performance optimizations not specified
- **FIO-INTEG-001 through FIO-INTEG-005**: Data integrity mechanisms missing

**Impact**: System will fail unpredictably with cloud-synced files (OneDrive, Dropbox) and lack robust error handling.

**Recommended Solution**: Create FileIOModule.md design or integrate file I/O utilities into the Infrastructure layer.

### 3. Agent Implementation Gaps (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Gap**: AgentsModule.md only provides high-level design; 21 specialized agents lack detailed implementations

**Missing Agent Designs**:
- Database Architect (08-database-architect-requirements.md)
- Performance Optimizer (07-performance-optimizer-requirements.md)
- Analysis Engine (10-analysis-engine-requirements.md)
- Pattern Emergence (14-pattern-emergence-requirements.md)
- Visualization Architect (16-visualization-architect-requirements.md)
- Content Researcher (18-content-researcher-requirements.md)
- SubAgent Architect (19-subagent-architect-requirements.md)
- Amplifier CLI Architect (21-amplifier-cli-architect-requirements.md)
- And 13 more specialized agents

**Impact**: Cannot implement specialized agent capabilities without detailed designs.

**Recommended Solution**: Create detailed design specifications for each agent or a comprehensive agent template system.

## Design-Requirement Conflicts

### 1. Multi-Store Knowledge System Conflict

**Issue**: KnowledgeModule.md has "enhanced" multi-store section at the end, but this appears to be an afterthought rather than core design.

**Conflicts**:
- **MKS-CREATE-001 through MKS-CREATE-008**: Store creation mechanisms not fully integrated
- **MKS-AGENT-001 through MKS-AGENT-008**: Agent-store mapping partially designed
- The enhanced section (lines 515-814) contradicts the single-store assumption in the main design

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Resolution**: Refactor KnowledgeModule.md to make multi-store the primary design, not an enhancement.

### 2. Team Coach Recursion Prevention

**Issue**: Team Coach design mentions recursion prevention but conflicts with hook integration patterns.

**Conflicts**:
- **TC-RECUR-001 through TC-RECUR-008**: Recursion prevention mechanisms may interfere with normal hook operations
- Hook system integration (TC-HOOK-001 through TC-HOOK-008) doesn't clearly separate reflection from normal operations

**Severity**: LOW

**Resolution**: Clarify session tagging and environment variable usage for clean separation.

## Partially Addressed Requirements

### 1. Synthesis Pipeline

**Status**: Addressed in KnowledgeModule.md but missing components

**Gaps**:
- **SYN-QRY-006 through SYN-QRY-010**: Query optimization not fully designed
- **SYN-PROC-001 through SYN-PROC-005**: Processing modes (batch, incremental, real-time) not detailed
- **SYN-CFG-006 through SYN-CFG-010**: Quality control mechanisms partially addressed

### 2. Memory System

**Status**: MemoryModule.md covers core functionality but missing some aspects

**Gaps**:
- **PV-MEM-001 and PV-MEM-002**: Privacy requirements not addressed in design
- **LR-MEM-001 and LR-MEM-002**: Learning pattern recognition partially designed

### 3. Validation System

**Status**: ValidationModule.md covers most requirements but gaps exist

**Gaps**:
- **TST-ENV-001 through TST-ENV-005**: Test environment management partially addressed
- **TST-GEN-004**: Regression test generation from bug reports not detailed

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

1. **Event System Absence**: System is blind without event tracking
2. **File I/O Robustness**: Production failures likely without proper handling
3. **Agent Coordination**: Complex interactions not fully specified

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Prioritize Event and File I/O module designs
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Create integration test suite early
4. Document agent interaction patterns

## Conclusion

The AgenticCoding system has comprehensive requirements and generally good module designs, but critical gaps exist that must be addressed before implementation:

1. **Event System** and **File I/O** modules are completely missing
2. **Agent implementations** lack specifications
3. **Multi-store knowledge** design needs integration

Addressing these gaps is essential for system success. The WorkspaceModule and PortableToolDesign show excellent alignment and can serve as templates for other modules.
