# Event System Requirements

## Overview
The system requires comprehensive event logging, streaming, and replay capabilities to track operations, debug issues, and provide audit trails.

## Event Logging Requirements

- **EVT-FILT-006**: The system SHALL support compound filter expressions.

### Event Streaming
- **EVT-STRM-001**: The system SHALL support real-time event tailing (follow mode).
- **EVT-STRM-002**: The system SHALL stream events as they are generated.
- **EVT-STRM-003**: The system SHALL buffer events when consumers are slow.
- **EVT-STRM-004**: The system SHALL support multiple concurrent event consumers.
- **EVT-STRM-005**: The system SHALL provide backpressure handling for event streams.

### Event Replay
- **EVT-RPLY-001**: The system SHALL replay historical events from a specific point.
- **EVT-RPLY-002**: The system SHALL replay events at configurable speeds.
- **EVT-RPLY-003**: The system SHALL replay filtered subsets of events.
- **EVT-RPLY-004**: The system SHALL maintain replay position across sessions.
- **EVT-RPLY-005**: The system SHALL support event replay for debugging.

## Event Categories Requirements

### Pipeline Events
- **EVT-PIPE-001**: The system SHALL log pipeline start and completion events.
- **EVT-PIPE-002**: The system SHALL log pipeline stage transitions.
- **EVT-PIPE-003**: The system SHALL log pipeline errors and exceptions.
- **EVT-PIPE-004**: The system SHALL log pipeline performance metrics.

### Hook Events
- **EVT-HOOK-001**: The system SHALL log session start and stop hook executions.
- **EVT-HOOK-002**: The system SHALL log post-tool-use hook executions.
- **EVT-HOOK-003**: The system SHALL log hook execution results and output.
- **EVT-HOOK-004**: The system SHALL log hook execution duration.
- **EVT-HOOK-005**: The system SHALL log hook configuration changes.

### Processing Events

- **EVT-PROC-002**: The system SHALL log extraction and synthesis operations.
- **EVT-PROC-003**: The system SHALL log batch processing progress.
- **EVT-PROC-004**: The system SHALL log processing failures and retries.
- **EVT-PROC-005**: The system SHALL log partial results and checkpoints.

## Event Storage Requirements

- **EVT-STOR-001**: The system SHALL rotate event logs based on size or age.
- **EVT-STOR-002**: The system SHALL compress archived event logs.
- **EVT-STOR-003**: The system SHALL maintain event log indexes for fast queries.
- **EVT-STOR-004**: The system SHALL handle concurrent writes to event logs safely.
- **EVT-STOR-005**: The system SHALL provide event log export capabilities.
- **EVT-STOR-006**: The system SHALL support configurable event retention policies.

## Event Analysis Requirements

- **EVT-ANAL-001**: The system SHALL generate event statistics and summaries.
- **EVT-ANAL-002**: The system SHALL detect event patterns and anomalies.
- **EVT-ANAL-003**: The system SHALL track event chains and correlations.
- **EVT-ANAL-004**: The system SHALL measure event frequency and distribution.
- **EVT-ANAL-005**: The system SHALL provide event timeline visualizations.
