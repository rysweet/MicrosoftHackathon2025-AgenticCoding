# Bug Hunter Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Systematically identifies and analyzes bugs, providing detailed debugging information and root cause analysis.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR3.1: MUST reproduce reported issues systematically
- FR3.2: MUST perform root cause analysis
- FR3.3: MUST identify all affected code paths
- FR3.4: MUST provide detailed debugging traces
- FR3.5: MUST suggest multiple fix approaches with trade-offs
- FR3.6: MUST create regression test cases

## Input Requirements
- IR3.1: Bug report or error description
- IR3.2: Steps to reproduce (if available)
- IR3.3: Error logs and stack traces
- IR3.4: Affected code context

## Output Requirements
- OR3.1: Root cause analysis report
- OR3.2: Affected files and line numbers
- OR3.3: Multiple fix options with pros/cons
- OR3.4: Regression test cases
- OR3.5: Debugging trace with state at each step

## Quality Requirements
- QR3.1: Must reproduce issue before proposing fixes
- QR3.2: Root cause analysis must be thorough and accurate
- QR3.3: Fix suggestions must not introduce new issues
- QR3.4: Test cases must prevent regression
