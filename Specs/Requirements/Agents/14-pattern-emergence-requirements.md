# Pattern Emergence Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Detects emergent patterns across data, identifying trends and systemic behaviors.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR14.1: MUST detect recurring patterns
- FR14.2: MUST identify emergent behaviors
- FR14.3: MUST track pattern evolution
- FR14.4: MUST classify pattern types
- FR14.5: MUST predict pattern trajectories
- FR14.6: MUST measure pattern strength

## Input Requirements
- IR14.1: Multi-dimensional data sets
- IR14.2: Temporal sequences
- IR14.3: Pattern detection parameters
- IR14.4: Significance thresholds

## Output Requirements
- OR14.1: Identified patterns with classifications
- OR14.2: Pattern evolution timeline
- OR14.3: Emergence indicators
- OR14.4: Pattern strength metrics
- OR14.5: Trajectory predictions

## Quality Requirements
- QR14.1: Patterns must be statistically significant
- QR14.2: Classifications must be consistent
- QR14.3: Predictions must include confidence intervals
- QR14.4: Evolution tracking must be continuous
