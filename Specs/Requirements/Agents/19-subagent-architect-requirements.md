# Subagent Architect Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Creates new specialized agents by analyzing requirements and generating proper agent definitions.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR19.1: MUST analyze task requirements for agent needs
- FR19.2: MUST design agent personas with expertise
- FR19.3: MUST craft comprehensive system prompts
- FR19.4: MUST define whenToUse criteria
- FR19.5: MUST ensure agent integration compatibility
- FR19.6: MUST generate valid agent definitions

## Input Requirements
- IR19.1: The agent must accept task or problem descriptions requiring specialized expertise
- IR19.2: The agent must consider the existing agent ecosystem context
- IR19.3: The agent must incorporate performance requirements
- IR19.4: The agent must respect integration constraints

## Output Requirements
- OR19.1: The agent must generate complete agent definitions in structured format with all required fields
- OR19.2: The agent must create system prompts with clear instructions
- OR19.3: The agent must define whenToUse criteria with concrete examples
- OR19.4: The agent must provide integration recommendations
- OR19.5: The agent must specify agent capability boundaries

## Quality Requirements
- QR19.1: Agents must be specialized not generic
- QR19.2: System prompts must be self-contained
- QR19.3: whenToUse must have concrete triggers
- QR19.4: Definitions must follow standards
