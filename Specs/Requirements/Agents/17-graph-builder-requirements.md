# Graph Builder Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Constructs multi-perspective knowledge graphs, preserving different viewpoints as valuable features.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR17.1: MUST extract SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object) triples
- FR17.2: MUST build multi-perspective graphs
- FR17.3: MUST track perspective sources
- FR17.4: MUST preserve parallel edges for different views
- FR17.5: MUST detect and highlight divergences
- FR17.6: MUST enrich nodes with multiple perspectives

## Input Requirements
- IR17.1: Agent outputs with knowledge extractions
- IR17.2: Perspective source identifiers
- IR17.3: Relationship extraction rules
- IR17.4: Graph construction parameters

## Output Requirements
- OR17.1: SPO triple collection with metadata
- OR17.2: Multi-perspective graph structure
- OR17.3: Perspective divergence analysis
- OR17.4: Node enrichment metrics
- OR17.5: Graph statistics and topology

## Quality Requirements
- QR17.1: All perspectives must be preserved
- QR17.2: Predicates must be 1-3 words maximum
- QR17.3: Source attribution must be maintained
- QR17.4: Divergences must be highlighted not hidden
