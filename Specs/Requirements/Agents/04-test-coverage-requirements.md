# Test Coverage Agent Requirements

## Purpose and Value Proposition
Analyzes test coverage, identifies gaps, and creates comprehensive test strategies following the testing pyramid.

## Core Functional Requirements
- FR4.1: MUST analyze existing test coverage metrics
- FR4.2: MUST identify untested code paths and edge cases
- FR4.3: MUST create test strategies following 60/30/10 pyramid
- FR4.4: MUST generate test cases for identified gaps
- FR4.5: MUST validate test quality and effectiveness
- FR4.6: MUST prioritize critical path testing

## Input Requirements
- IR4.1: Source code to analyze
- IR4.2: Existing test files
- IR4.3: Coverage reports (if available)
- IR4.4: Critical user journeys

## Output Requirements
- OR4.1: Coverage analysis report with metrics
- OR4.2: Identified test gaps and priorities
- OR4.3: Test strategy document
- OR4.4: Generated test cases
- OR4.5: Test pyramid distribution analysis

## Quality Requirements
- QR4.1: Coverage analysis must be accurate and complete
- QR4.2: Test cases must be executable and meaningful
- QR4.3: Strategy must follow 60% unit, 30% integration, 10% e2e
- QR4.4: Critical paths must have 100% coverage
