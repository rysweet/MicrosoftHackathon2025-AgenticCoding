# Modular Design Philosophy Requirements

## Purpose
Ensure the system implements and maintains the "bricks and studs" modular architecture pattern, enabling AI-driven module regeneration, parallel development, and clear separation between specifications and implementations.

## Core Modular Architecture Requirements

### Bricks and Studs Pattern

#### FR-MD-001: Module as Self-Contained Bricks
- MUST create modules as self-contained directories with all required files
- MUST ensure each module delivers one clear responsibility
- MUST include tests and documentation within module directory
- MUST expose only public contracts via __all__ exports
- MUST enable modules to be deleted and regenerated without affecting others

#### FR-MD-002: Contracts as Connection Points (Studs)
- MUST define stable public contracts for module interfaces
- MUST maintain contracts separately from implementations
- MUST ensure contracts remain unchanged during regeneration
- MUST validate contract compatibility before module integration
- MUST document contracts in module README or docstrings

#### FR-MD-003: Module Size and Boundaries
- MUST limit modules to context that fits in single AI prompt
- MUST ensure module boundaries align with functional responsibilities
- MUST prevent cross-module internal dependencies
- MUST enforce clear import boundaries between modules
- MUST support module composition for larger features

### Module Regeneration Capability

#### FR-MD-004: Specification-Driven Regeneration
- MUST regenerate entire modules from specifications
- MUST maintain module specifications separate from code
- MUST support complete module regeneration without patches
- MUST preserve module behavior during regeneration
- MUST validate regenerated modules against specifications

#### FR-MD-005: Regeneration Over Editing
- MUST prefer module regeneration over line-by-line editing
- MUST track when modules need regeneration vs editing
- MUST provide tools for module regeneration workflow
- MUST ensure regeneration doesn't break dependent modules
- MUST support A/B testing of regenerated variants

#### FR-MD-006: Parallel Module Generation
- MUST support generating multiple module variants simultaneously
- MUST enable parallel testing of different implementations
- MUST track performance across module variants
- MUST support merging learnings from parallel experiments

## Blueprint-Driven Development

### FR-MD-007: Blueprint as Specification
- MUST create blueprints before implementation

### FR-MD-008: Human as Architect Role
- MUST separate specification creation from implementation
- MUST enable humans to work exclusively at specification level

- MUST present results at behavior level, not code level
- MUST support specification-level testing and validation

### FR-MD-009: AI as Builder Role
- MUST delegate module implementation to AI agents
- MUST ensure AI can build from specifications alone
- MUST validate AI-generated modules automatically
- MUST support AI regeneration without human intervention
- MUST track AI generation success rates and quality

## Module Lifecycle Management

### FR-MD-010: Module Creation Workflow

- MUST determine if update requires regeneration or editing
- MUST regenerate when contract changes are needed
- MUST regenerate dependent modules when contracts change

- MUST support rollback to previous module versions

### FR-MD-012: Module Deletion and Cleanup
- MUST support clean module removal
- MUST detect and update dependent modules
- MUST remove module artifacts completely
- MUST update module registry after deletion

## Parallel Development Support

### FR-MD-013: Parallel Solution Building
- MUST support building multiple solutions simultaneously
- MUST isolate parallel builds from each other

### FR-MD-014: Variant Management
- MUST track all module variants created
- MUST compare variant performance and quality
- MUST support promoting variants to production
- MUST maintain variant history and rationale
- MUST enable variant rollback if needed

### FR-MD-015: Learning from Variants
- MUST extract patterns from successful variants
- MUST identify why certain variants perform better
- MUST update specifications based on learnings
- MUST propagate improvements across modules
- MUST document variant experiment outcomes

## Module Quality Requirements

### FR-MD-016: Module Independence
- MUST ensure modules can be understood in isolation
