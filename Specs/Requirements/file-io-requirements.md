# File I/O & Cloud Sync Requirements

## Overview
The system requires robust file input/output operations with special handling for cloud-synchronized storage services and network file systems.

## File Operation Requirements

### Basic File Operations
- **FIO-BASIC-001**: The system SHALL provide atomic write operations for critical data files.
- **FIO-BASIC-002**: The system SHALL support reading and writing structured data files with proper encoding.
- **FIO-BASIC-003**: The system SHALL support reading and writing text files with configurable encoding.
- **FIO-BASIC-004**: The system SHALL validate file permissions before attempting operations.
- **FIO-BASIC-005**: The system SHALL handle file locking for concurrent access scenarios.

### Cloud Sync Handling
- **FIO-CLOUD-001**: The system SHALL detect when files are located in cloud-synchronized directories.
- **FIO-CLOUD-002**: The system SHALL implement retry logic for file operations that fail due to cloud sync delays.
- **FIO-CLOUD-003**: The system SHALL use exponential backoff when retrying failed file operations.
- **FIO-CLOUD-004**: The system SHALL provide informative warnings when cloud sync interference is detected.
- **FIO-CLOUD-005**: The system SHALL handle placeholder files from cloud storage services gracefully.
- **FIO-CLOUD-006**: The system SHALL manage files that are not locally cached by cloud services.
- **FIO-CLOUD-007**: The system SHALL continue operation when individual files are temporarily unavailable.

### Error Recovery
- **FIO-ERROR-001**: The system SHALL implement configurable retry attempts for transient failures.
- **FIO-ERROR-002**: The system SHALL distinguish between transient and permanent file operation failures.
- **FIO-ERROR-003**: The system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes.
- **FIO-ERROR-004**: The system SHALL provide graceful degradation when files cannot be accessed.
- **FIO-ERROR-005**: The system SHALL report specific error codes in failure messages.
- **FIO-ERROR-006**: The system SHALL suggest remediation steps for common file access problems.

### Cross-Platform File Handling
- **FIO-CROSS-001**: The system SHALL handle symlinked directories between different file systems.
- **FIO-CROSS-002**: The system SHALL clean security metadata files created by operating systems.
- **FIO-CROSS-003**: The system SHALL remove platform-specific security descriptors when appropriate.
- **FIO-CROSS-004**: The system SHALL detect the execution environment and adapt file operations accordingly.
- **FIO-CROSS-005**: The system SHALL handle operations across different file system types.

## Performance Requirements

- **FIO-PERF-001**: The system SHALL implement buffered I/O for large file operations.
- **FIO-PERF-002**: The system SHALL support streaming reads for large files.
- **FIO-PERF-003**: The system SHALL minimize file system calls through batching.
- **FIO-PERF-004**: The system SHALL cache frequently accessed file metadata.
- **FIO-PERF-005**: The system SHALL flush write buffers explicitly for critical data.

## Data Integrity Requirements

- **FIO-INTEG-001**: The system SHALL verify file integrity after write operations.
- **FIO-INTEG-002**: The system SHALL use temporary files with atomic rename for critical writes.
- **FIO-INTEG-003**: The system SHALL maintain backup copies before overwriting existing files.
- **FIO-INTEG-004**: The system SHALL detect and report corrupted files.
- **FIO-INTEG-005**: The system SHALL implement checksums for data validation.
