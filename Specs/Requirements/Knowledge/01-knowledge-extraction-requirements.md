# Knowledge Extraction Requirements

## Purpose
Extract structured knowledge from unstructured text documents, including concepts, relationships, insights, and patterns.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Extraction Capabilities

#### FR-KE-001: Multi-Level Knowledge Extraction
- MUST extract concepts with definitions from text
- MUST identify relationships between concepts (SPO triples)
- MUST discover insights and key takeaways
- MUST find patterns across content
- MUST extract metadata (source, timestamp, context)

#### FR-KE-002: Batch Processing
- MUST process multiple documents in parallel
- MUST support incremental extraction without reprocessing
- MUST handle large document collections (100+ documents)
- MUST track processing status per document
- MUST support resumable batch operations

#### FR-KE-003: Extraction Configuration
- MUST support configurable extraction depth (surface/deep)
- MUST allow customizable extraction templates
- MUST support different extraction styles (comprehensive/focused)
- MUST enable selective extraction (concepts only, relationships only, etc.)
- MUST support chunk size configuration for large documents

#### FR-KE-004: Source Management
- MUST track extraction provenance (source attribution)
- MUST fingerprint content for change detection
- MUST maintain source-to-extraction mappings
- MUST support multiple content formats (Markdown, PDF, text)
- MUST preserve source context in extractions

#### FR-KE-005: Quality Control
- MUST validate extraction completeness
- MUST detect and report extraction failures
- MUST provide confidence scores for extractions
- MUST identify low-quality or ambiguous extractions
- MUST support extraction review and refinement

## Input Requirements

### IR-KE-001: Content Sources
- Text documents in various formats (MD, PDF, TXT)
- Content directory paths
- URL sources for web content
- Document metadata (title, author, date)

### IR-KE-002: Configuration
- Extraction templates and patterns
- Chunk size limits (default: 10,000 words)
- Parallel processing limits
- Quality thresholds

## Output Requirements

### OR-KE-001: Extracted Knowledge
- Concepts with definitions and context
- Relationships as SPO triples
- Insights with supporting evidence
- Patterns with examples
- Metadata for each extraction

### OR-KE-002: Processing Reports
- Extraction statistics (success/failure rates)
- Processing time per document
- Quality metrics
- Error logs with details

## Performance Requirements

### PR-KE-001: Processing Speed
- MUST process documents within 10-30 seconds each
- MUST support parallel processing of 5+ documents
- MUST handle documents up to 50,000 words

### PR-KE-002: Scalability
- MUST scale to 1000+ documents in knowledge base
- MUST maintain performance with growing knowledge base
- MUST support incremental updates efficiently

## Reliability Requirements

### RR-KE-001: Fault Tolerance
- MUST handle partial extraction failures gracefully
- MUST save progress during batch processing
- MUST support retry mechanisms for failed extractions
- MUST continue processing on individual document failures

### RR-KE-002: Data Integrity
- MUST preserve all extracted knowledge on crashes
- MUST maintain consistency between source and extractions
- MUST validate extraction data before storage
