IMPORTANT: This is a WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK TEST. You MUST follow EVERY step in .claude/workflow/DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md completely.

TASK: Add a new utility function called `slugify` to src/amplihack/utils/string_utils.py that:
1. Takes a string and converts it to a URL-friendly slug
2. Converts to lowercase, replaces spaces with hyphens, removes special characters
3. Write comprehensive tests in tests/unit/test_string_utils.py

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT SKIP ANY OF THESE:
1. Follow ALL 22 steps (Steps 0-21) in .claude/workflow/DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md
2. Create todos for ALL steps at the beginning (Step 0)
3. Create a GitHub issue first (Step 3)
4. Create a worktree branch named feat/issue-XXX-benchmark-slugify (Step 4)
5. Label the PR with "benchmarking" label
6. MANDATORY: Execute Steps 16-17 (Review the PR and implement review feedback)
7. MANDATORY: Post your code review as a COMMENT on the PR using gh pr comment (not just in your output)
8. MANDATORY: Mark the PR as ready for review (Step 20)

This test measures workflow compliance. Skipping steps, especially 16-17, is a test failure.

When complete, the PR should have:
- A review comment posted to it
- The "benchmarking" label
- Be marked as ready (not draft)
