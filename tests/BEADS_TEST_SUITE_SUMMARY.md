# Beads Integration Test Suite Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive test suite for beads integration following TDD approach and the testing pyramid (60% unit, 30% integration, 10% E2E).

**Total Test Functions: ~40 test functions across 9 test files**

## Test Distribution

### Unit Tests (60% - 24 test functions)

#### 1. test_beads_provider.py (8 test functions)
Tests BeadsMemoryProvider interface implementation:
- ✓ Issue creation (all fields, minimal fields, validation)
- ✓ Issue retrieval (success, not found, with relationships)
- ✓ Issue updates (status, multiple fields, metadata)
- ✓ Issue closure (success, with metadata)
- ✓ Relationship management (blocks, related, parent-child, discovered-from)
- ✓ Relationship retrieval (all types, filtered)
- ✓ Ready work queries (no blockers, filtered by assignee/labels)
- ✓ Error handling (adapter unavailable, errors, retries)
- ✓ Performance tests (< 100ms for queries)

- Temporary repository fixtures (with/without issues)
- Helper function fixtures (validation, context creation)
- Parametrized test data (all statuses, relationship types, query filters)
- Performance testing fixtures (timing helpers)

## Test Execution

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Run all beads tests
pytest tests/unit/memory/test_beads_*.py tests/integration/test_beads_*.py tests/e2e/test_beads_*.py -v

# Run by category
pytest tests/unit/memory/test_beads_*.py -v  # Unit tests
pytest tests/integration/test_beads_*.py -v  # Integration tests
pytest tests/e2e/test_beads_*.py -v -m e2e  # E2E tests

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/unit/memory/test_beads_*.py --cov=amplihack.memory --cov-report=html

# Skip slow tests
pytest tests/ -m "not slow" -v
```

### Expected Behavior (TDD)

**ALL TESTS SHOULD FAIL INITIALLY** because the implementation does not exist yet:
- Import errors: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'amplihack.memory.beads_provider'`
- Missing classes: `BeadsMemoryProvider`, `BeadsAdapter`, `BeadsModels`, `BeadsSync`
- Missing methods: All provider methods, adapter methods, sync methods

### Implementation Order

Follow this order to make tests pass:

1. **Phase 1: Models** (test_beads_models.py)
   - Create `amplihack/memory/beads_models.py`
   - Implement `BeadsIssue`, `BeadsRelationship`, `BeadsWorkstream`
   - Add validation, serialization methods

2. **Phase 2: Adapter** (test_beads_adapter.py)
   - Create `amplihack/memory/beads_adapter.py`
   - Implement CLI wrapper with subprocess calls
   - Add JSON parsing, retry logic

3. **Phase 3: Sync** (test_beads_sync.py)
   - Create `amplihack/memory/beads_sync.py`
   - Implement JSONL export handling
   - Add git coordination, debounce logic

4. **Phase 4: Provider** (test_beads_provider.py)
   - Create `amplihack/memory/beads_provider.py`
   - Implement `BeadsMemoryProvider` interface
   - Connect to adapter, handle errors

5. **Phase 5: Integration** (integration tests)
   - Integrate with workflow executor
   - Integrate with memory manager
   - Implement agent context restoration

6. **Phase 6: E2E** (e2e tests)
   - Full workflow testing
   - Installation and setup
   - Verification with real beads CLI (if available)

## Critical User Requirements Validated

All explicit user requirements are tested:

1. **Persistent agent memory across sessions** ✓
   - test_beads_provider.py: test_get_issue_success
   - test_beads_agent_context.py: test_restore_context_from_issue_history

2. **Graph-based issue tracking with dependencies** ✓
   - test_beads_provider.py: test_add_relationship_blocks
   - test_beads_full_workflow.py: test_dependency_blocking_workflow

3. **Git-distributed state** ✓
   - test_beads_sync.py: test_full_sync_workflow_success
   - test_beads_sync.py: test_detect_jsonl_export_exists

4. **Workflow integration** ✓
   - test_beads_workflow_integration.py: test_step2_creates_beads_issue
   - test_beads_workflow_integration.py: test_workflow_updates_issue_status_on_step_completion

## Performance Requirements

All performance-critical tests include assertions:
- Query operations: < 100ms (test_beads_provider.py)
- Sync operations: < 1000ms (test_beads_sync.py)
- Debounce prevents excessive syncs (test_beads_sync.py)

## Edge Cases Covered

- Empty inputs (empty title, description, issue ID)
- Invalid statuses and relationship types
- Self-referential relationships
- Merge conflicts in JSONL export
- Beads unavailable (graceful degradation)
- Network errors during sync
- Concurrent operations
- Very long titles/descriptions
- Special characters in fields

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Clear test names**: test_<method>_<scenario>_<expected_result>
- **Comprehensive docstrings**: What each test validates
- **Fixture reuse**: Reduces duplication
- **Performance assertions**: Explicit timing requirements
- **Error path testing**: Both success and failure paths
- **Isolation**: Mocked external dependencies
- **Deterministic**: No flaky tests (mocked time, subprocess)

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to verify they fail (TDD confirmation)
2. Begin implementation starting with Phase 1 (Models)
3. Run tests incrementally as implementation progresses
4. Achieve green tests for each phase before moving to next
5. Verify E2E tests with real beads CLI if available

## Notes

- Tests use pytest markers: `@pytest.mark.e2e`, `@pytest.mark.slow`
- Mocks use `unittest.mock` for consistency
- All subprocess calls are mocked for speed and reliability
- E2E tests skip if beads CLI not available
- Fixtures in conftest_beads.py should be imported/merged into main conftest.py
