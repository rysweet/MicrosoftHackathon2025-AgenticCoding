# DISCOVERIES.md

This file documents non-obvious problems, solutions, and patterns discovered during development. It serves as a living knowledge base that grows with the project.

## Format for Entries

Each discovery should follow this format:

```markdown
## [Brief Title] (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Issue
What problem or challenge was encountered?

### Root Cause
Why did this happen? What was the underlying issue?

### Solution
How was it resolved? Include code examples if relevant.

### Key Learnings
What insights were gained? What should be remembered?

### Prevention
How can this be avoided in the future?
```

## Project Initialization (2025-01-16)

### Issue
Setting up the agentic coding framework with proper structure and philosophy.

### Root Cause
Need for a well-organized, AI-friendly project structure that supports agent-based development.

### Solution
Created comprehensive `.claude` directory structure with:
- Context files for philosophy and patterns
- Agent definitions for specialized tasks
- Command system for complex workflows
- Hook system for session tracking
- Runtime directories for metrics and analysis

### Key Learnings
1. **Structure enables AI effectiveness** - Clear organization helps AI agents work better
2. **Philosophy guides decisions** - Having written principles prevents drift
3. **Patterns prevent wheel reinvention** - Documented solutions save time
4. **Agent specialization works** - Focused agents outperform general approaches

### Prevention
Always start projects with clear structure and philosophy documentation.

<!-- New discoveries will be added here as the project progresses -->

## Remember

- Document immediately while context is fresh
- Include specific error messages and stack traces
- Show actual code that fixed the problem
- Think about broader implications
- Update PATTERNS.md when a discovery becomes a reusable pattern
